{"id":"bd-iq7n","title":"Audit and fix JSONL filename mismatches across all repo clones","description":"## Problem\n\nMultiple clones of repos are configured with different JSONL filenames (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl), causing:\n1. JSONL files to be resurrected after deletion (one clone pushes issues.jsonl, another pushes beads.jsonl)\n2. Agents unable to see issues filed by other agents after sync\n3. Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen repos were \"bd doctored\" or initialized at different times, some got issues.jsonl (old default) and others got beads.jsonl (Beads repo specific). These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2. List of repos grouped by git remote (same repository)\n3. Fix script or manual instructions for standardizing each repo\n4. Verification that after fixes, all clones of the same repo use the same JSONL filename\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Handle repos without metadata.json (use default discovery)\n- Handle repos with no git remote (standalone/local)\n- Handle repos that are not git repositories\n- Don't modify repos with uncommitted changes (warn instead)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All clones of the same git repository use the same JSONL filename\n- No duplicate JSONL files in any repo\n- All configurations documented in metadata.json\n- bd doctor passes on all repos","status":"open","issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00"}

Expired tombstones (\u003e30 days) remain in issues.jsonl  \n3. User must separately run bd compact to prune tombstones\n4. bd doctor warns about expired tombstones: Run bd compact to prune\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nbd cleanup should also prune expired tombstones from issues.jsonl.\n\n## Impact\n\nWith v0.30.0 making tombstones the default migration path, this UX gap becomes more visible.

Add to cmd/bd/main.go:\n   - `lockTimeout time.Duration` global variable  \n   - Register flag: `--lock-timeout=\u003cduration\u003e` (default 30s)\n\n2. Add config support in internal/config/config.go:\n   - `v.SetDefault(\"lock-timeout\", \"30s\")`\n   - Read from config.yaml if not set via flag\n\n3. Pass timeout to sqlite.New() - see next task\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `bd --lock-timeout=0 list` fails immediately if DB is locked\n- `bd --lock-timeout=100ms list` waits max 100ms\n- Config file setting works: `lock-timeout: 100ms`\n- Default remains 30s for backward compatibility\n\nPart of bd-olc1","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-13T17:54:36.277179-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

When 5+ clones create issues with same ID, Git merge conflicts require manual resolution, and our collision resolver can fail during convergence rounds.\n\n## Research Question\nCould jujutsu (jj) provide better conflict handling for JSONL files?\n\n## Jujutsu Overview\n- Next-gen VCS built on libgit2\n- Designed to handle conflicts as first-class citizens\n- Supports conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) in some scenarios\n- Better handling of concurrent edits\n- Can work with Git repos (compatible with existing infrastructure)\n\n## Investigation Tasks\n1. JSONL Merge Behavior - How does jj handle line-by-line JSONL conflicts?\n2. Integration Feasibility - Can beads use jj as backend while maintaining Git compatibility?\n3. Conflict Resolution Model - Does jj conflict model map to our collision resolution?\n4. Operational Transform Support - Does jj implement operational transforms?\n\n## Deliverables\n1. Technical report on jj merge algorithm for JSONL\n2. Proof-of-concept: 5-clone collision test using jj instead of Git\n3. Performance comparison: Git vs jj for beads workload\n4. Recommendation: Adopt, experiment further, or abandon\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/martinvonz/jj\n- Related to bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.953008-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.3","title":"Implement global N-way collision resolution algorithm","description":"## Overview\nPhase 3: Replace pairwise collision resolution with global N-way resolution that produces deterministic results regardless of sync order.\n\n## Current Problem\nScoreCollisions (collision.go:228) compares issues pairwise:\n```go\ncollision.RemapIncoming = existingHash \u003c incomingHash\n```\n\nThis works for 2-way but fails for 3+ way because:\n- Each clone makes local decisions without global context\n- No guarantee intermediate states are consistent\n- Remapping decisions depend on sync order\n- Can't detect transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n\n## Solution\nImplement global resolution that:\n1. Collects ALL versions of same logical issue\n2. Sorts by content hash (deterministic)\n3. Assigns sequential IDs based on sorted order\n4. All clones converge to same assignments\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create ResolveNWayCollisions function\nFile: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions with:\n```go\n// ResolveNWayCollisions handles N-way collisions deterministically.\n// Groups all versions with same base ID, sorts by content hash,\n// assigns sequential IDs. Returns mapping of old ID → new ID.\nfunc ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    collisions []*CollisionDetail, incoming []*types.Issue) (map[string]string, error) {\n    \n    if len(collisions) == 0 {\n        return make(map[string]string), nil\n    }\n    \n    // Group by base ID pattern (e.g., test-1, test-2 → base \"test-1\")\n    groups := groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions)\n    \n    idMapping := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for baseID, versions := range groups {\n        // 1. Collect all unique versions by content hash\n        uniqueVersions := deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(versions)\n        \n        // 2. Sort by content hash (deterministic!)\n        sort.Slice(uniqueVersions, func(i, j int) bool {\n            return uniqueVersions[i].ContentHash \u003c uniqueVersions[j].ContentHash\n        })\n        \n        // 3. Assign sequential IDs based on sorted order\n        prefix := extractPrefix(baseID)\n        baseNum := extractNumber(baseID)\n        \n        for i, version := range uniqueVersions {\n            targetID := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d\", prefix, baseNum+i)\n            \n            // Map this version to its deterministic ID\n            if version.ID != targetID {\n                idMapping[version.ID] = targetID\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return idMapping, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// groupCollisionsByBaseID groups collisions by their logical base ID\nfunc groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions []*CollisionDetail) map[string][]*types.Issue {\n    groups := make(map[string][]*types.Issue)\n    for _, c := range collisions {\n        baseID := c.ID  // All share same ID (that's why they collide)\n        groups[baseID] = append(groups[baseID], c.ExistingIssue, c.IncomingIssue)\n    }\n    return groups\n}\n\n// deduplicateVersionsByContentHash keeps one issue per unique content hash\nfunc deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(issues []*types.Issue) []*types.Issue {\n    seen := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        if _, found := seen[issue.ContentHash]; !found {\n            seen[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n        }\n    }\n    result := make([]*types.Issue, 0, len(seen))\n    for _, issue := range seen {\n        result = append(result, issue)\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update handleCollisions in importer\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions call with:\n```go\n// OLD:\nif err := sqlite.ScoreCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult.Collisions, allExistingIssues); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to score collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// NEW:\nidMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n    collisionResult.Collisions, issues)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to resolve collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update RemapCollisions\nRemapCollisions currently uses collision.RemapIncoming field. Update to use idMapping directly:\n- Remove RemapIncoming logic\n- Use idMapping to determine what to remap\n- Simplify to just apply the computed mapping\n\n### 5. Add comprehensive tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. 3-way collision with different content → 3 sequential IDs\n2. 3-way collision with 2 identical content → 2 IDs (dedupe works)\n3. Sync order independence (A→B→C vs C→A→B produce same result)\n4. Content hash ordering is respected\n5. Works with 5+ clones\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ResolveNWayCollisions implemented and replaces ScoreCollisions\n- Groups all versions of same ID together\n- Deduplicates by content hash\n- Sorts by content hash deterministically\n- Assigns sequential IDs starting from base ID\n- Returns complete mapping (old ID → new ID)\n- All clones converge to same ID assignments\n- Works for arbitrary N-way collisions\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes (or gets much closer)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (new function, helpers)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (call new function)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (comprehensive tests)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- groupCollisionsByBaseID correctly groups\n- deduplicateVersionsByContentHash removes duplicates\n- Sorting by hash is stable and deterministic\n- Sequential ID assignment is correct\n\n### Integration Tests\n- 3-way collision resolves to 3 issues\n- Sync order doesn't affect final IDs\n- Content hash ordering determines winner\n\n### Property Tests\n- For any N clones with same content, all converge to same IDs\n- Idempotent: running resolution twice produces same result\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field) to be completed first\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection) for clean integration\n\n## Notes\nThis is the core algorithm that enables convergence. The key insight:\n**Sort by content hash globally, not pairwise comparison.**","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:37:42.85616-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.228707-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:03:26.675257-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.593102-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.30886-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.336312-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"bd-hy9p","title":"Add --body-file flag to bd create for reading descriptions from files","description":"## Problem\n\nCreating issues with long/complex descriptions via CLI requires shell escaping gymnastics:\n\n```bash\n# Current workaround - awkward heredoc quoting\nbd create --title=\"...\" --description=\"$(cat \u003c\u003c'EOF'\n...markdown...\nEOF\n)\"\n\n# Often fails with quote escaping errors in eval context\n# Agents resort to writing temp files then reading them\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd `--body-file` and `--description-file` flags to read description from a file, matching `gh` CLI pattern.\n\n```bash\n# Natural pattern that aligns with training data\ncat \u003e /tmp/desc.md \u003c\u003c 'EOF'\n...markdown content...\nEOF\n\nbd create --title=\"...\" --body-file=/tmp/desc.md\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add new flags to `bd create`\n\n```go\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"body-file\", \"\", \"Read description from file (use - for stdin)\")\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"description-file\", \"\", \"Alias for --body-file\")\n```\n\n### 2. Flag precedence\n\n- If `--body-file` or `--description-file` is provided, read from file\n- If value is `-`, read from stdin\n- Otherwise fall back to `--body` or `--description` flag\n- If neither provided, description is empty (current behavior)\n\n### 3. Error handling\n\n- File doesn't exist → clear error message\n- File not readable → clear error message\n- stdin specified but not available → clear error message\n\n## Benefits\n\n✅ **Matches training data**: `gh issue create --body-file file.txt` is a common pattern\n✅ **No shell escaping issues**: File content is read directly\n✅ **Works with any content**: Markdown, special characters, quotes, etc.\n✅ **Agent-friendly**: Agents already write complex content to temp files\n✅ **User-friendly**: Easier for humans too when pasting long descriptions\n\n## Related Commands\n\nConsider adding similar support to:\n- `bd update --body-file` (for updating descriptions)\n- `bd comment --body-file` (if/when we add comments)\n\n## Examples\n\n```bash\n# From file\nbd create --title=\"Add new feature\" --body-file=feature.md\n\n# From stdin\necho \"Quick description\" | bd create --title=\"Bug fix\" --body-file=-\n\n# With other flags\nbd create \\\n  --title=\"Security issue\" \\\n  --type=bug \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --body-file=security-report.md \\\n  --label=security\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- Test with normal files\n- Test with stdin (`-`)\n- Test with non-existent files (error handling)\n- Test with binary files (should handle gracefully)\n- Test with empty files (valid - empty description)\n- Test that `--description-file` and `--body-file` are equivalent aliases","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-22T00:02:08.762684-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-22T00:02:08.762684-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-k92d","title":"Critical: Beads deletes issues during sync (GH#464)","description":"# Findings\n\n## Root Cause 1: git-history-backfill deletes issues during repo ID mismatch\n\n**Location:** internal/importer/importer.go, purgeDeletedIssues()\n\nThe git-history-backfill mechanism checks git history to find deleted issues. When there's a repo ID mismatch (e.g., database from a different clone or after remote URL change), this can incorrectly treat local issues as deleted because they don't exist in the remote's git history.\n\n**Fix Applied:** Added safety guard at lines 971-987 in importer.go that:\n- Checks issue status before deletion via git-history-backfill\n- Prevents deletion of open/in_progress issues\n- Provides clear warning with actionable steps\n- Suggests using --no-git-history flag or bd delete for explicit deletion\n\n## Root Cause 2: Daemon sync race condition overwrites local unpushed changes\n\n**Location:** cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go, performAutoImport()\n\nThe daemon sync's auto-import function pulls from remote without checking for uncommitted local changes. This can overwrite local work that hasn't been pushed yet.\n\n**Fix Applied:** Added warning at lines 565-575 in daemon_sync.go that:\n- Checks for uncommitted changes before pulling\n- Warns user about potential overwrite\n- Suggests running 'bd sync' to commit/push first\n- Continues with pull but user is informed\n\n## Additional Safety Improvements\n\n1. Enhanced repo ID mismatch error message (daemon_sync.go:362-371)\n   - Added warning about deletion risk\n   - Clarified that mismatch can cause incorrect deletions\n\n2. Safety guard in deletions manifest processing (importer.go:886-902)\n   - Prevents deletion of open/in_progress issues in deletions.jsonl\n   - Provides diagnostic information\n   - Suggests recovery options\n\n3. Updated tests (purge_test.go)\n   - Changed test to use closed issue (safe to delete)\n   - Verifies safety guard works correctly\n\n## Testing\n\nAll tests pass:\n- go test ./internal/importer/... ✓\n- go build ./cmd/bd/ ✓\n\nThe safety guards now prevent both root causes from deleting active work.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-14T23:00:19.36203-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

When user manually runs git pull, daemon doesn't detect JSONL was updated externally and continues serving stale data from SQLite.\n\nImpact:\n- High for AI agents using beads in git workflows\n- Breaks fundamental git-as-source-of-truth model\n- Confusing UX: git log shows commit, bd shows old state\n- Data consistency issues between JSONL and daemon\n\nSee WYVERN_SYNC_ISSUE.md for full analysis.","notes":"**Fixed in v0.21.2!**\n\nThe daemon auto-import is fully implemented:\n- internal/autoimport package handles staleness detection\n- internal/importer package provides shared import logic (used by both CLI and daemon)\n- daemon's checkAndAutoImportIfStale() calls autoimport.AutoImportIfNewer()\n- importFunc uses importer.ImportIssues() with auto-rename enabled\n- All tests passing\n\nThe critical data corruption bug is FIXED:\n✅ After git pull, daemon detects JSONL is newer (mtime check)\n✅ Daemon auto-imports before serving requests\n✅ No stale data served\n✅ No data loss in multi-agent workflows\n\nVerification needed: Run two-repo test to confirm end-to-end behavior.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-25T23:13:12.270766-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

Run 'bd import' first.\"\n- Same safety check that exists for 'bd sync' should apply to ALL operations\n\n**Impact:**\n- Users make decisions based on incomplete/outdated data\n- Silent failures lead to confusion (e.g., thinking issues don't exist when they do)\n- Similar to running git commands on stale repo without being warned to pull\n\n**Example:**\n- Searched for bd-g9eu issue file: not found\n- Issue exists in .beads/issues.jsonl (in git)\n- Database was stale, but no warning was given\n- Led to incorrect conclusion that issue was already closed/deleted","notes":"## Implementation Complete\n\n**Phase 1: Created staleness check (cmd/bd/staleness.go)**\n- ensureDatabaseFresh() function checks JSONL mtime vs last_import_time\n- Returns error with helpful message when database is stale\n- Auto-skips in daemon mode (daemon has auto-import)\n\n**Phase 2: Added to all read commands**\n- list, show, ready, status, stale, info, duplicates, validate\n- Check runs before database queries in direct mode\n- Daemon mode already protected via checkAndAutoImportIfStale()\n\n**Phase 3: Code Review Findings**\nSee follow-up issues:\n- bd-XXXX: Add warning when staleness check errors\n- bd-YYYY: Improve CheckStaleness error handling\n- bd-ZZZZ: Refactor redundant daemon checks (low priority)\n\n**Testing:**\n- Build successful: go build ./cmd/bd\n- Binary works: ./bd --version\n- Ready for manual testing\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1.

{"id":"bd-srwk","title":"bd export should detect and prevent stale database exports","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen `bd export` is run with a stale database (older than issues.jsonl), it silently overwrites the JSONL file with stale data, causing data loss.\n\n## What Happened (vc project)\n\n1. Agent A created 4 new issues and exported to issues.jsonl (commit 99a9d58)\n2. Agent A closed an issue and exported again (commit 58b4613) - JSONL now has 4 epics\n3. Agent B had stale database (from before step 1)\n4. Agent B worked on unrelated issue and exported (commit 0609233)\n5. Agent B's export **overwrote issues.jsonl**, removing the 4 epics created by Agent A\n6. Required manual recovery by re-exporting from Agent A's correct database\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd export` should detect that the database is stale and either:\n- **Refuse to export** with error message explaining the issue\n- **Warn prominently** and require explicit --force flag to override\n- **Auto-import first** to sync database before exporting\n\n## How to Detect Staleness\n\nCompare modification times (similar to VC's ValidateDatabaseFreshness):\n1. Check .db, .db-wal, .db-shm timestamps (use newest for WAL mode)\n2. Check issues.jsonl timestamp\n3. If JSONL is newer by \u003e1 second: database is stale\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd staleness check in `bd export`:\n\n```go\nfunc Export(dbPath, jsonlPath string, force bool) error {\n    // Check if database is stale\n    if !force {\n        if err := checkDatabaseFreshness(dbPath, jsonlPath); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"database is stale: %w\\n\" +\n                \"Run 'bd import %s' first to sync, or use --force to override\",\n                err, jsonlPath)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with export...\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity**: High (silent data loss)\n- **Frequency**: Happens in multi-agent workflows when agents don't sync\n- **Workaround**: Manual recovery (re-export from correct database)\n\n## References\n\n- VC issue tracker: commits 58b4613 -\u003e 0609233 -\u003e c41c638\n- VC has similar check: `storage.ValidateDatabaseFreshness()`\n- Tolerance: 1 second (handles filesystem timestamp precision)","notes":"Fixed with ID-based comparison instead of just count. Now detects:\n1. DB has fewer issues than JSONL (count check)\n2. DB has different issues than JSONL (ID comparison)\n\nBoth scenarios now properly refuse export unless --force is used.\n\nImplementation uses getIssueIDsFromJSONL() to build a set of IDs from JSONL, then checks if any JSONL IDs are missing from DB.

{"id":"bd-8931","title":"Daemon gets stuck when auto-import blocked by git conflicts","description":"CRITICAL: The daemon enters a corrupt state that breaks RPC commands when auto-import is triggered but git pull fails due to uncommitted changes.\n\nImpact: This is a data integrity and usability issue that could cause users to lose trust in Beads. The daemon silently fails for certain commands while appearing healthy.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Make local changes to issues (creates uncommitted .beads/beads.jsonl)\n2. Remote has updates (JSONL newer, triggers auto-import)\n3. Daemon tries to pull but fails: 'cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes'\n4. Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181425-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181857-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-e6d71828","title":"Add transaction + retry logic for N-way collision resolution","description":"## Problem\nCurrent N-way collision resolution fails on UNIQUE constraint violations during convergence rounds when 5+ clones sync. The RemapCollisions function is non-atomic and performs operations sequentially:\n1. Delete old issues (CASCADE deletes dependencies)\n2. Create remapped issues (can fail with UNIQUE constraint)\n3. Recreate dependencies\n4. Update text references\n\nFailure at step 2 leaves database in inconsistent state.\n\n## Solution\nWrap collision resolution in database transaction with retry logic:\n- Make entire RemapCollisions operation atomic\n- Retry up to 3 times on UNIQUE constraint failures\n- Re-sync counters between retries\n- Add better error messages for debugging\n\n## Implementation\nLocation: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go:342 (RemapCollisions function)\n\n```go\n// Retry up to 3 times on UNIQUE constraint failures\nfor attempt := 0; attempt \u003c 3; attempt++ {\n    err := s.db.ExecInTransaction(func(tx *sql.Tx) error {\n        // All collision resolution operations\n    })\n    if !isUniqueConstraintError(err) {\n        return err\n    }\n    s.SyncAllCounters(ctx)\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 5-clone collision test passes reliably\n- No partial state on UNIQUE constraint errors\n- Automatic recovery from transient ID conflicts\n\n## References\n- See beads_nway_test.go:124 for the KNOWN LIMITATION comment\n- Related to-7c5915ae (transaction support)","notes":"## Progress Made\n\n1. Added `ExecInTransaction` helper to SQLiteStorage for atomic database operations\n2. Added `IsUniqueConstraintError` function to detect UNIQUE constraint violations\n3. Wrapped `RemapCollisions` with retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with counter sync between retries\n4. Enhanced `handleRename` to detect and handle race conditions where target ID already exists\n5. Added defensive checks for when old ID has been deleted by another clone\n\n## Test Results\n\nThe changes improve N-way collision handling but don't fully solve the problem:\n- Original error: `UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id` during first convergence round\n- With changes: Test proceeds further but encounters different collision scenarios\n- New error: `target ID already exists with different content` in later convergence rounds\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is more complex than initially thought. In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Values are not documented in tool schema\n\n## Recommended Solution\nAdd environment variables or MCP tool parameters:\n- `BEADS_MCP_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD` env var (default: 20)\n- `BEADS_MCP_PREVIEW_COUNT` env var (default: 5)\n- Optional `compact_threshold` and `preview_size` parameters to list/ready tools\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Keep current defaults for backward compatibility\n- Read from environment at server initialization\n- Document in CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md\n- Add tests verifying env var behavior","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:34.037997-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-4u2b","depends_on_id":"bd-otf4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:34.039165-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Fix rootCtx (5 min) - unblocks tests\n2. Reduce sleep durations 10x (2 min) - saves ~280ms\n3. Use in-memory DBs (10 min) - saves ~1s\n4. Share test fixtures (15 min) - saves ~1.2s\n5. Fix skipped debounce test (5 min)\n\n## Expected Results\n\n- Tests go from hanging → \u003c5s total runtime\n- Keep critical integration test coverage\n- Tests caught real bugs: bd-270, bd-206, bd-160\n\n## Files\n\n- Analysis: MAIN_TEST_REFACTOR_NOTES.md\n- Solution: MAIN_TEST_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md\n- Tests: cmd/bd/main_test.go (18 tests, 1322 LOC)\n\n## Priority\n\nP1 - Blocking development, tests unusable in current state","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-21T18:27:48.942814-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

Clarify interaction with project-level .beads/ (BEADS_DIR takes precedence)\n\n## Current Support\n\nAlready implemented in internal/beads/beads.go:FindDatabasePath():\n- BEADS_DIR env var is checked first (preferred)\n- BEADS_DB env var still supported (deprecated)\n- Falls back to .beads/ search in tree\n\nJust needs documentation for the multi-agent workspace pattern.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-15T22:08:22.158027-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T22:08:22.158027-08:00"}

Correctness: Does getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() handle all edge cases?\n2. Performance: Calling getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() 3x per sync (snapshot capture, merge, base update) - should we cache?\n3. Error handling: What if some repos fail snapshot operations but others succeed?\n4. Race conditions: Multiple daemons in different repos?\n5.

Overall assessment: Core deletion tracking logic is sound, but error handling and path handling issues make this not yet production-ready for multi-repo scenarios.\n\nKey findings:\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES (Priority 1):\n1. Inconsistent error handling in daemon_sync.go - snapshot/merge fail hard but base update warns. Can leave DB in inconsistent state with no rollback. See bd-sjmr.\n2. No path normalization in getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() - tilde expansion, relative paths, duplicates not handled. See bd-iye7.\n\nSHOULD FIX (Priority 2):\n3. Missing test coverage for edge cases - empty paths, duplicates, partial failures. See bd-kdoh.\n4. Performance - getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() called 3x per sync (minor issue). See bd-we4p.\n\nWHAT WORKS WELL:\n- Atomic file operations with PID-based temp files\n- Good snapshot isolation between repos\n- Race condition protection via exclusive locks\n- Solid test coverage for happy path scenarios\n\nVERDICT: Address bd-iye7 and bd-sjmr before considering deletion tracking production-ready for multi-repo mode.\n\nDetailed review notes available in conversation history.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:23:52.402949-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-xo6b","depends_on_id":"bd-rbxi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:23:52.403723-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Pre-push hook ran successfully and exported DB → JSONL\n2. Push completed\n3. Shortly after, daemon exported DB → JSONL again with different content\n4. Diff shows comments added to old issues (bd-23a8, bd-6049, bd-87a0)\n\nTimeline:\n- Commit c731c45 \"Update beads JSONL\"\n- Pre-push hook exported JSONL\n- Push succeeded\n- Daemon PID 33314 exported again with different content\n\nQuestions:\n1. Did someone run a command between commit and daemon export?\n2. Is there a timing issue where pre-push hook doesn't capture all DB changes?\n3. Should pre-commit hook flush daemon changes before committing?\n\nThe comments appear to be from Nov 5 (created_at: 2025-11-05T08:38:46Z) but are only appearing in JSONL now. This suggests the DB had these comments but they weren't exported during pre-push.\n\nPossible causes:\n- Pre-push hook uses BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 which might skip pending writes\n- Daemon has unflushed changes in memory\n- Race condition between pre-push export and daemon's periodic export","notes":"Improved fix based on oracle code review:\n1. Pre-push now flushes pending changes first (prevents debounce race)\n2. Uses git status --porcelain to catch all change types\n3. Handles both beads.jsonl and issues.jsonl\n4.

Then tries to prune tombstones older than N days (finds none because they were just created)\n\nThis leaves the database bloated with fresh tombstones that will not be pruned.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nIn --hard mode, the deletion should be permanent without creating tombstones, since the user explicitly requested bypassing sync safety.\n\n## Workaround\n\nManually delete from database: sqlite3 .beads/beads.db 'DELETE FROM issues WHERE status=tombstone'\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. In --hard mode, use a different delete path that does not create tombstones\n2. After deleting, immediately prune the just-created tombstones regardless of age\n3. Pass a skip_tombstone flag to the delete operation\n\nOption 1 is cleanest - --hard should mean permanent delete without tombstone.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-16T01:33:36.580657-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T01:33:36.580657-08:00"}

TestThreeCloneCollision demonstrates this with reproducible failures.\n\n## Root Causes Identified\n1. Pairwise resolution doesn't scale - each clone makes local decisions without global context\n2. DetectCollisions modifies state during detection (line 83-86 in collision.go)\n3. No remapping history - can't track transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n4. Import-time resolution is too late - happens after git merge\n\n## Solution Architecture\nReplace pairwise resolution with deterministic global N-way resolution using:\n- Content-addressable identity (content hashing)\n- Global collision resolution (sort all versions by hash)\n- Read-only detection phase (separate from modification)\n- Idempotent imports (content-first matching)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes without skipping\n- All clones converge to identical content after final pull\n- No data loss (all issues present in all clones)\n- Works for N workers (test with 5+ clones)\n- Idempotent imports (importing same JSONL multiple times is safe)\n\n## Implementation Phases\nSee child issues for detailed breakdown of each phase.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.889079-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"bd-7a2b58fc","title":"Implement clone-scoped ID allocation to prevent N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\nCurrent ID allocation uses per-clone atomic counters (issue_counters table) that sync based on local database state. In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.952447-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

Study working test patterns in init_test.go, list_test.go, etc.\n2. Ensure BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 is set\n3. Properly initialize database with bd init\n4. Use the command's global store, not a separate instance\n5.

However, the constants could be shared.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nExport the constants from types package and import them in merge:\n\n```go\n// merge/merge.go\nimport \"github.com/steveyegge/beads/internal/types\"\n\n// Use types.StatusTombstone, types.DefaultTombstoneTTL, types.ClockSkewGrace\n```\n\nOr create a shared constants package if import cycles are a concern.\n\n## Files\n- internal/merge/merge.go:241-248\n- internal/types/types.go:77-84, 170","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-05T16:36:06.159443-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

When `bd cleanup` tries to convert a closed issue to a tombstone, this constraint fails if:\n1. The issue has status='closed' but closed_at is NULL, OR\n2. The issue is being converted but the tombstone creation doesn't properly handle the closed_at field\n\n## Impact\n\n- `bd cleanup --force` cannot complete\n- 722 closed issues cannot be cleaned up\n- Blocks routine maintenance\n\n## Investigation Needed\n\n1. Check the bd-okh record in the database:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT id, status, closed_at, deleted_at FROM issues WHERE id = 'bd-okh';\n   ```\n2. Determine if this is data corruption or a bug in tombstone creation\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n1. **If data corruption**: Add a `bd doctor --fix` check that repairs status/closed_at mismatches\n2. **If code bug**: Fix the tombstone creation to properly handle the constraint\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- `internal/storage/sqlite/sqlite.go` - DeleteIssue / tombstone creation\n- Schema CHECK constraint definition\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Identify root cause (data vs code bug)\n- [ ] `bd cleanup --force` completes successfully\n- [ ] `bd doctor` detects status/closed_at mismatches","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-13T23:49:54.012806-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T02:19:57.236953-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T17:30:05.427749-08:00"}

The valid placeholders are:\n- `%O` = base (common ancestor)\n- `%A` = current version (ours)\n- `%B` = other version (theirs)\n\n## Impact\n\n- Affects ALL users when they have `.beads/beads.jsonl` merge conflicts\n- Automatic JSONL merge fails with error: \"error reading left file: failed to open file: open 7: no such file or directory\"\n- Users must manually resolve conflicts instead of getting automatic merge\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `bd init` command (or wherever the merge driver is configured) is using non-standard placeholders. When Git encounters `%L` and `%R`, it either passes them literally or interprets them incorrectly.\n\n## Fix\n\nUpdate the merge driver configuration to:\n```\ngit config merge.beads.driver \"bd merge %A %O %A %B\"\n```\n\nWhere:\n- 1st `%A` = output file (current file, will be overwritten)\n- `%O` = base (common ancestor)\n- 2nd `%A` = left/current version\n- `%B` = right/other version\n\n## Action Items\n\n1.

{"id":"bd-55sb","title":"Stealth mode global gitignore should use absolute project path","description":"**GitHub Issue:** #538\n\n**Problem:**\n`bd init --stealth` adds `.beads/` to the global gitignore, which ignores ALL `.beads/` folders across all repositories. Users who want stealth mode in one project but open beads usage in others are blocked.\n\n**Solution:**\nChange stealth mode to use absolute paths instead of generic patterns:\n\n**Before (current):**\n```\n# Beads stealth mode configuration (added by bd init --stealth)\n.beads/\n.claude/settings.local.json\n```\n\n**After (proposed):**\n```\n# Beads stealth mode: /Users/foo/work-project (added by bd init --stealth)\n/Users/foo/work-project/.beads/\n/Users/foo/work-project/.claude/settings.local.json\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Modify `setupGlobalGitIgnore()` in `cmd/bd/init.go`\n2. Get current working directory (absolute path)\n3. Use absolute path patterns instead of generic ones\n4. Update comment to show which project the entry is for\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- If project directory moves, gitignore entry becomes stale (acceptable - user can re-run `bd init --stealth`)\n- Multiple stealth projects = multiple entries (works correctly)\n\n**Testing:**\n- Verify absolute path is added to global gitignore\n- Verify other projects' .beads/ folders are NOT ignored\n- Test with existing global gitignore file\n- Test creating new global gitignore file","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-13T10:55:22.594278-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

This leads to a foreign key constraint failure if the issue does not exist.\n\nWe need to:\n1. Create reproduction tests for these failure cases\n2. Apply the same fix pattern: check `RowsAffected()` after the update, and return a proper \"issue not found\" error if it is 0, before attempting to insert the event.\n3.

The workflow is:\n1. Delete from DB\n2. Auto-import runs (reads old JSONL from git with deleted issues still present)\n3. Issues come back\n4. Export writes partially-deleted state\n\n**Solution options:**\n1. Add `--no-auto-import` flag to bulk delete operations\n2. Atomic delete-export-commit operation that suppresses imports\n3. Dedicated `bd prune` command that handles this correctly\n4. Lock file to prevent auto-import during bulk mutations\n\n**Impact:**\n- Bulk cleanup operations don't work reliably\n- Makes it nearly impossible to prune old closed issues\n- Confusing UX (delete 244, but only 112 actually removed)","notes":"**FIXED**: Auto-import now skips during delete operations to prevent resurrection.\n\n**Root cause confirmed**: Auto-import was running in PersistentPreRun before delete executed, causing it to re-import stale JSONL from git and resurrect deleted issues.\n\n**Solution implemented**:\n1. Added delete to skip list in main.go PersistentPreRun (alongside import and sync --dry-run)\n2. Delete operations now complete atomically without auto-import interference\n3. Added comprehensive test (TestBulkDeleteNoResurrection) to prevent regression\n\n**Test verification**:\n- Creates 20 issues, deletes 10\n- Verifies no resurrection after delete\n- Confirms JSONL has correct count (10 remaining)\n- All existing tests still pass","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-08T03:01:09.796852-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

Validates that bd-rtp and bd-yb8 work correctly.\n\n## Test Coverage Needed\n\n### 1. Cancellation Tests\n- [ ] Import operation cancelled mid-stream\n- [ ] Export operation cancelled mid-stream  \n- [ ] Database query cancelled during long operation\n- [ ] No corruption after cancellation\n- [ ] Proper cleanup (defers execute, connections closed)\n\n### 2. Timeout Tests\n- [ ] Operations respect context deadlines\n- [ ] Appropriate error messages on timeout\n- [ ] State remains consistent after timeout\n\n### 3. Signal Handling Tests\n- [ ] SIGINT (Ctrl+C) triggers cancellation\n- [ ] SIGTERM triggers graceful shutdown\n- [ ] Multiple signals handled correctly\n\n## Implementation Approach\n```go\nfunc TestImportCancellation(t *testing.T) {\n    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())\n    \n    // Start import in goroutine\n    go func() {\n        err := runImport(ctx, largeFile)\n        assert.Error(err, context.Canceled)\n    }()\n    \n    // Cancel after short delay\n    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\n    cancel()\n    \n    // Verify database integrity\n    assertDatabaseConsistent(t, store)\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Create/Update\n- cmd/bd/import_test.go - cancellation tests\n- cmd/bd/export_test.go - cancellation tests\n- internal/storage/sqlite/*_test.go - context timeout tests\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All critical operations have cancellation tests\n- [ ] Tests verify database integrity after cancellation\n- [ ] Signal handling tested (if feasible)\n- [ ] Test coverage \u003e80% for context paths","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-20T21:27:22.854636-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-2o2","depends_on_id":"bd-yb8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-20T21:27:22.855574-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","title":"Update documentation for hash IDs and aliases","description":"Update all documentation to explain hash-based IDs and aliasing system.\n\n## Files to Update\n\n### 1. README.md\nAdd section explaining hash IDs:\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs\n\nBeads uses **hash-based IDs** for collision-free distributed issue tracking:\n\n- **Hash ID**: `bd-af78e9a2` (8-char SHA256 prefix, immutable, globally unique)\n- **Alias**: `#42` (sequential number, mutable, human-friendly)\n\n### Using IDs\n```bash\nbd show bd-af78e9a2   # Use hash ID\nbd show #42           # Use alias\nbd show 42            # Use alias (shorthand)\n```\n\n### Why Hash IDs?\n- **Collision-free**: Work offline without ID conflicts\n- **Distributed**: No coordination needed between clones\n- **Git-friendly**: Different IDs = different JSONL lines, fewer merge conflicts\n\n### Aliases\nAliases are workspace-local shortcuts for hash IDs. They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3. QUICKSTART.md (if exists)\nShow alias usage in examples:\n```bash\n# Create issue (gets hash ID + alias)\nbd create \"Fix authentication bug\" -p 1\n# → Created bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #1)\n\n# Reference by alias\nbd show #1\nbd update #1 --status in_progress\nbd close #1 --reason \"Fixed\"\n```\n\n### 4. ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5. MIGRATION.md (new file)\n```markdown\n# Migrating to Hash-Based IDs (v2.0)\n\n## Overview\nBeads v2.0 introduces hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems. This is a **breaking change** requiring migration.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Backup\n```bash\ncp -r .beads .beads.backup\ngit commit -am \"Pre-migration backup\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5. Resume normal work\n\n## Rollback\n```bash\n# Restore backup\nmv .beads.backup .beads\nbd export  # Regenerate JSONL\ngit checkout .beads/issues.jsonl\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I mix v1.x and v2.0 clones?**\nA: No. All clones must be on same version.\n\n**Q: Will my old issue IDs work?**\nA: No, but aliases preserve the numbers: bd-1c63eb84 → #1\n\n**Q: What happens to links like \"see bd-cb64c226.3\"?**\nA: Migration updates all text references automatically.\n```\n\n### 6. CHANGELOG.md\n```markdown\n## v2.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **Hash-based IDs**: Issues now use collision-free hash IDs (bd-af78e9a2)\n  instead of sequential IDs (bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda)\n- **Aliasing system**: Human-friendly aliases (#42) for hash IDs\n- **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate --hash-ids` to convert v1.x databases\n\n### Added\n- `bd alias` command for manual alias control\n- `bd migrate --hash-ids` migration tool\n- Alias conflict resolution (deterministic, content-hash ordering)\n\n### Removed\n- ID collision detection and resolution (~2,100 LOC)\n- `bd import --resolve-collisions` flag (no longer needed)\n\n### Benefits\n- ✅ Zero ID collisions in distributed workflows\n- ✅ Simpler codebase (-1,350 net LOC)\n- ✅ Better git merge behavior\n- ✅ True offline-first operation\n```\n\n## Testing\n- Build docs locally (if using doc generator)\n- Check all links work\n- Verify examples are correct\n- Spellcheck\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- README.md (hash ID section)\n- AGENTS.md (workflow updates)\n- ADVANCED.md (internals)\n- MIGRATION.md (new)\n- CHANGELOG.md (v2.0 entry)\n- docs/ (any other docs)","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.979971-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981344-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981767-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.13","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.982167-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Update error messages in cmd/bd/compact.go lines 106-114 (analyze) and 121-137 (apply)\n2. Add explicit hint: \"Use --no-daemon flag to bypass daemon\"\n3. Change SQLite check error from \"requires SQLite storage\" to \"failed to open database in direct mode\"\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- cmd/bd/compact.go (lines ~106-137)\n\n**Testing:**\n- Run with daemon: `bd compact --analyze` should show clear error + hint\n- Run with --no-daemon: `bd compact --analyze --no-daemon` should work\n- Verify error message is actionable","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-20T20:47:45.606924-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-9ae788be","title":"Implement clone-scoped ID allocation to prevent N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\nCurrent ID allocation uses per-clone atomic counters (issue_counters table) that sync based on local database state. In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:52.260524-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

Windows takes 30+ min without.\n\n## Current State\n\n- Windows jobs have continue-on-error: true (don't block PRs)\n- Tests timeout before completing, providing zero signal\n- RAM disk experiments added complexity without solving the problem\n\n## Solution: Smoke Tests Only\n\nReplace full test suite with minimal smoke tests that verify Windows compatibility in \u003c 2 minutes.\n\n### What to Test\n1. Binary builds - go build succeeds (already separate step)\n2. Binary executes - bd version works\n3. Init works - bd init creates valid database\n4. Basic CRUD - create, list, show, update, close\n5. Path handling - Windows backslash paths work\n\n### Proposed CI Change\n\nReplace test-windows-cmd and test-windows-internal with single smoke test job:\n- Build bd.exe\n- Run: bd version\n- Run: bd init --quiet --prefix smoke\n- Run: bd create --title \"Windows smoke test\" --type task\n- Run: bd list\n- Run: bd show smoke-001\n- Run: bd update smoke-001 --status in_progress\n- Run: bd close smoke-001\n\n### Benefits\n- Completes in \u003c 2 minutes vs 30+ minute timeouts\n- Provides actual pass/fail signal\n- Verifies Windows binary works\n- Removes RAM disk complexity\n- Single job instead of two parallel jobs\n\n### Files to Change\n- .github/workflows/ci.yml - Replace test-windows-cmd and test-windows-internal jobs\n\n### Migration Steps\n1. Remove test-windows-cmd job\n2. Remove test-windows-internal job\n3. Add single test-windows job with smoke tests\n4. Remove continue-on-error (tests should now pass reliably)\n5. Clean up RAM disk remnants from previous attempts\n\n### Context\n- Parent issue: bd-5we (Use RAM disk for Windows CI tests)\n- RAM disk approach proved insufficient\n- This is the pragmatic solution after extensive experimentation","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-13T07:28:32.445588-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Start Amp with beads MCP server configured\n2. Call `mcp__beads__set_context(workspace_root=\"/path/to/project\")`\n3. Use MCP tools successfully (e.g., `mcp__beads__show`, `mcp__beads__list`)\n4.

Try to use MCP tools without calling `set_context` again\n6. **Result**: \"Not connected\" or \"No workspace set\" errors\n\n## Impact\n- Amp agents silently fail when trying to read/update beads issues\n- May attempt to create duplicate issues because they can't see existing ones\n- Potential for data corruption if operating on wrong database\n- Breaks multi-session workflows\n- Creates confusion: CLI works (`./bd`) but MCP tools don't\n\n## Current Workaround\nManually call `mcp__beads__set_context()` at start of every Amp session.\n\n## Root Cause\nMCP server is stateful and doesn't persist workspace context across restarts.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n**Option 1 (Best)**: Auto-detect workspace from current working directory\n- Match behavior of CLI `./bd` commands\n- Check for `.beads/` directory in current dir or parents\n- No manual context setting needed\n\n**Option 2**: Persist context in MCP server state file\n- Save last workspace_root to `~/.config/beads/mcp_context.json`\n- Restore on server startup\n\n**Option 3**: Require explicit context in every MCP call\n- Add optional `workspace_root` parameter to all MCP tools\n- Fall back to saved context if not provided\n\nAcceptance:\n- MCP tools work across Amp restarts without manual set_context()\n- Auto-detection matches CLI behavior (walks up from CWD)\n- Clear error message when no workspace found\n- set_context() still works for explicit override\n- BEADS_WORKING_DIR env var support\n- Integration test validates restart behavior","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T23:50:52.083111-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-627d","title":"AI-supervised database migrations for safer schema evolution","description":"## Problem\n\nDatabase migrations can lose user data through edge cases that are hard to anticipate (e.g., GH #201 where bd migrate failed to set issue_prefix, or bd-d355a07d false positive data loss warnings). Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","notes":"## Progress\n\n### ✅ Phase 1: Migration Invariants (COMPLETED)\n\n**Implemented:**\n- Created internal/storage/sqlite/migration_invariants.go with 3 invariants\n- Updated RunMigrations() to verify invariants after migrations\n- All tests pass ✓\n\n### ✅ Phase 2: Inspection Tools (COMPLETED \u0026 PUSHED)\n\n**Commit:** 1abe4e7 - \"Add migration inspection tools for AI agents (bd-627d Phase 2)\"\n\n**Implemented:**\n1. ✅ bd migrate --inspect --json - Shows migration plan\n2. ✅ bd info --schema --json - Returns schema details\n3. ✅ Migration warnings system\n4. ✅ Documentation updated in AGENTS.md\n5. ✅ All tests pass\n\n### ✅ Phase 3: MCP Tools (COMPLETED \u0026 PUSHED)\n\n**Commit:** 2493693 - \"Add MCP tools for migration inspection (bd-627d Phase 3)\"\n\n**Implemented:**\n1. ✅ inspect_migration(workspace_root) tool in beads-mcp\n2. ✅ get_schema_info(workspace_root) tool in beads-mcp\n3. ✅ Abstract methods in BdClientBase\n4. ✅ CLI client implementations\n5. ✅ All tests pass\n\n**All phases complete!** Migration inspection fully integrated into MCP server.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-02T12:57:10.722048-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.4","title":"Make DetectCollisions read-only (separate detection from modification)","description":"## Overview\nPhase 2: Separate collision detection from state modification to enable safe, composable collision resolution.\n\n## Current Problem\nDetectCollisions (collision.go:38-111) modifies database state during detection:\n- Line 83-86: Deletes issues when content matches but ID differs\n- This violates separation of concerns\n- Causes race conditions when processing multiple issues\n- Makes contentToDBIssue map stale after first deletion\n- Partial failures leave DB in inconsistent state\n\n## Solution\nMake DetectCollisions purely read-only. Move all modifications to a separate ApplyCollisionResolution function.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Add RenameDetail to CollisionResult\nFile: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n```go\ntype CollisionResult struct {\n    ExactMatches []string\n    Collisions   []*CollisionDetail\n    NewIssues    []string\n    Renames      []*RenameDetail  // NEW\n}\n\ntype RenameDetail struct {\n    OldID string        // ID in database\n    NewID string        // ID in incoming\n    Issue *types.Issue  // The issue with new ID\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Remove deletion from DetectCollisions\nReplace lines 83-86:\n```go\n// OLD (DELETE THIS):\nif err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, dbMatch.ID); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete renamed issue...\")\n}\n\n// NEW (ADD THIS):\nresult.Renames = append(result.Renames, \u0026RenameDetail{\n    OldID: dbMatch.ID,\n    NewID: incoming.ID,\n    Issue: incoming,\n})\ncontinue  // Don't mark as NewIssue yet\n```\n\n### 3. Create ApplyCollisionResolution function\nNew function to apply all modifications atomically:\n```go\nfunc ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    result *CollisionResult, mapping map[string]string) error {\n    \n    // Phase 1: Handle renames (delete old IDs)\n    for _, rename := range result.Renames {\n        if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, rename.OldID); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete renamed issue %s: %w\", \n                rename.OldID, err)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Create new IDs (from mapping)\n    // Phase 3: Update references\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update callers to use two-phase approach\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions)\n```go\n// Phase 1: Detect (read-only)\ncollisionResult, err := sqlite.DetectCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, issues)\n\n// Phase 2: Resolve (compute mapping)\nmapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult)\n\n// Phase 3: Apply (modify DB)\nerr = sqlite.ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult, mapping)\n```\n\n### 5. Update tests\n- Verify DetectCollisions doesn't modify DB\n- Test ApplyCollisionResolution separately\n- Add test for rename detection without modification\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- DetectCollisions performs zero writes to database\n- DetectCollisions returns RenameDetail entries for content matches\n- ApplyCollisionResolution handles all modifications\n- All existing tests still pass\n- New test verifies read-only detection\n- contentToDBIssue map stays consistent throughout detection\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (DetectCollisions, new function)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions caller)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (add tests)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: DetectCollisions with content match doesn't delete DB issue\n- Unit test: RenameDetail correctly populated\n- Unit test: ApplyCollisionResolution applies renames\n- Integration test: Full flow still works end-to-end\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nThis is a significant refactor of core collision logic. Recommend:\n1. Add comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Use feature flag to enable/disable new behavior\n3. Test thoroughly with TestTwoCloneCollision first","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:37:09.652326-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.228266-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T19:08:17.715416-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.570276-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.285653-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bd-d3f0","title":"Add 'bd comment' as alias for 'bd comments add'","description":"The command 'bd comments add' is verbose and unintuitive. Add 'bd comment' as a shorter alias that works the same way.\n\n## Rationale\n- More natural: 'bd comment \u003cissue-id\u003e \u003ctext\u003e' reads better than 'bd comments add \u003cissue-id\u003e \u003ctext\u003e'\n- Matches user expectations: users naturally try 'bd comment' first\n- Follows convention: other commands like 'bd create', 'bd show', 'bd close' are verbs\n\n## Implementation\nCould be implemented as:\n1. A new command that wraps bd comments add\n2. An alias registered in cobra\n3. Keep 'bd comments add' for backwards compatibility\n\n## Examples\n```bash\nbd comment bd-1234 'This is a comment'\nbd comment bd-1234 'Multi-line comment' --body 'Additional details here'\n```","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:13:18.82563-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

But finding an ID in history doesn't necessarily mean it was deleted - it could mean:\n\n1. The issue was added (appears in a commit adding it)\n2. The issue was modified (appears in commits updating it)\n3. The issue was deleted (appears in a commit removing it)\n\nThe current logic incorrectly treats all three cases as 'deleted'.\n\n## Correct Logic\n\n`git log -S` with `--oneline` shows commits where the string was added OR removed. To detect deletion specifically:\n\n1. ID appears in git history (was once in JSONL)\n2. ID is NOT currently in JSONL\n\nThe second condition is already checked by the caller (`purgeDeletedIssues`), so technically the logic is correct in context. But the function name and doc comment are misleading.\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. **Rename function** to `wasEverInJSONL` and update doc comment to clarify\n2. **Add explicit check** for current JSONL state in the function itself\n\nOption 1 is simpler and correct since caller already filters.","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-25T12:46:16.073661-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-1rh","title":"cmd/bd test suite is absurdly slow - 279 tests taking 8+ minutes","description":"# Problem\n\nThe cmd/bd test suite is painfully slow:\n- **279 tests** in cmd/bd alone\n- Full suite takes **8+ minutes** to run\n- Even with the 16 slowest integration tests now tagged with `integration` build tag, the remaining tests still take forever\n\nThis makes the development loop unusable. We can't wait 8+ minutes every time we want to run tests.\n\n# Root Cause Analysis\n\n## 1. Sheer Volume\n279 tests is too many for a single package. Even at 0.1s per test, that's 28 seconds minimum just for cmd/bd.\n\n## 2. Each Test Creates Full Database + Temp Directories\nEvery test does heavy setup:\n- Creates temp directory (`t.TempDir()` or `os.MkdirTemp`)\n- Initializes SQLite database\n- Sets up git repo in many cases\n- Creates full storage layer\n\nExample from the tests:\n```go\nfunc setupCLITestDB(t *testing.T) string {\n    tmpDir := createTempDirWithCleanup(t)\n    runBDInProcess(t, tmpDir, \"init\", \"--prefix\", \"test\", \"--quiet\")\n    return tmpDir\n}\n```\n\nThis happens 279 times!\n\n## 3. Tests Are Not Properly Categorized\nWe have three types of tests mixed together:\n- **Unit tests** - should be fast, test single functions\n- **Integration tests** - test full workflows, need DB/git\n- **End-to-end tests** - test entire CLI commands\n\nThey're all lumped together in cmd/bd, all running every time.\n\n# What We've Already Fixed\n\nAdded `integration` build tags to 16 obviously-slow test files:\n- import_profile_test.go (performance benchmarking tests)\n- export_mtime_test.go (tests with time.Sleep calls)\n- cli_fast_test.go (full CLI integration tests)\n- delete_test.go, import_uncommitted_test.go, sync_local_only_test.go (git integration)\n- And 10 more in internal/ packages\n\nThese are now excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n## Option 1: Shared Test Fixtures (Quick Win)\nCreate a shared test database that multiple tests can use:\n```go\nvar testDB *sqlite.SQLiteStorage\nvar testDBOnce sync.Once\n\nfunc getSharedTestDB(t *testing.T) storage.Storage {\n    testDBOnce.Do(func() {\n        // Create one DB for all tests\n    })\n    return testDB\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, immediate speedup\n**Cons**: Tests become less isolated, harder to debug failures\n\n## Option 2: Table-Driven Tests (Medium Win)\nCollapse similar tests into table-driven tests:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct{\n        name string\n        args []string\n        want string\n    }{\n        {\"basic issue\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\"}, \"created\"},\n        {\"with description\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\", \"-d\", \"desc\"}, \"created\"},\n        // ... 50 more cases\n    }\n    \n    db := setupOnce(t) // Setup once, not 50 times\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            // test using shared db\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Dramatically reduces setup overhead, tests run in parallel\n**Cons**: Requires refactoring, tests share more state\n\n## Option 3: Split cmd/bd Tests Into Packages (Big Win)\nMove tests into focused packages:\n- `cmd/bd/internal/clitests` - CLI integration tests (mark with integration tag)\n- `cmd/bd/internal/unittests` - Fast unit tests\n- Keep only essential tests in cmd/bd\n\n**Pros**: Clean separation, easy to run just fast tests\n**Cons**: Requires significant refactoring\n\n## Option 4: Parallel Execution (Quick Win)\nAdd `t.Parallel()` to independent tests:\n```go\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Run this test concurrently with others\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to add, can cut time in half on multi-core machines\n**Cons**: Doesn't reduce actual test work, just parallelizes it\n\n## Option 5: In-Memory Databases (Medium Win)\nUse `:memory:` SQLite databases instead of file-based:\n```go\nstore, err := sqlite.New(ctx, \":memory:\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Faster than disk I/O, easier cleanup\n**Cons**: Some tests need actual file-based DBs (export/import tests)\n\n# Recommended Approach\n\n**Short-term (this week)**:\n1. Add `t.Parallel()` to all independent tests in cmd/bd\n2. Use `:memory:` databases where possible\n3. Create table-driven tests for similar test cases\n\n**Medium-term (next sprint)**:\n4. Split cmd/bd tests into focused packages\n5. Mark more integration tests appropriately\n\n**Long-term (backlog)**:\n6. Consider shared test fixtures with proper isolation\n\n# Current Status\n\nWe've tagged 16 files with `integration` build tag, but the remaining 279 tests in cmd/bd still take 8+ minutes. This issue tracks fixing the cmd/bd test performance specifically.\n\n# Target\n\nGet `go test ./...` (without `-short` or `-tags=integration`) down to **under 30 seconds**.\n\n\n# THE REAL ROOT CAUSE (Updated Analysis)\n\nAfter examining the actual test code, the problem is clear:\n\n## Every Test Creates Its Own Database From Scratch\n\nLook at `create_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens NEW SQLite connection\n                                                    // ← Runs migrations\n                                                    // ← Sets config\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDescription(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates ANOTHER temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens ANOTHER SQLite connection\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n```\n\n**This happens 279 times!**\n\n## These Tests Don't Need Isolation!\n\nMost tests are just checking:\n- \"Can I create an issue with a title?\"\n- \"Can I create an issue with a description?\"\n- \"Can I add labels?\"\n\nThey don't conflict with each other. They could all share ONE database!\n\n## The Fix: Test Suites with Shared Setup\n\nInstead of:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDesc(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n```\n\nDo this:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    // ONE setup for all subtests\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")\n    \n    t.Run(\"basic_issue\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()  // Can run concurrently - tests don't conflict\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"with_description\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    // ... 50 more subtests, all using same DB\n}\n```\n\n**Result**: 50 tests → 1 database setup instead of 50!\n\n## Why This Works\n\nSQLite is fine with concurrent reads and isolated transactions. These tests:\n- ✅ Create different issues (no ID conflicts)\n- ✅ Just read back what they created\n- ✅ Don't depend on database state from other tests\n\nThey SHOULD share a database!\n\n## Real Numbers\n\nCurrent:\n- 279 tests × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **8 minutes**\n\nAfter fix:\n- 10 test suites × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **30 seconds**\n- 279 subtests running in parallel using those 10 DBs = **5 seconds**\n\n**Total: ~35 seconds instead of 8 minutes!**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Group related tests** into suites (Create, List, Update, Delete, etc.)\n2. **One setup per suite** instead of per test\n3. **Use t.Run() for subtests** with t.Parallel()\n4. **Keep tests that actually need isolation** separate (export/import tests, git operations)\n\nThis is way better than shuffling tests into folders!","notes":"## Progress Update (2025-11-21)\n\n✅ **Completed**:\n- Audited all 280 tests, created TEST_SUITE_AUDIT.md ([deleted:[deleted:bd-c49]])\n- Refactored create_test.go to shared DB pattern ([deleted:[deleted:bd-y6d]])\n- Proven the pattern works: 11 tests now run in 0.04s with 1 DB instead of 11\n\n❌ **Current Reality**:\n- Overall test suite: Still 8+ minutes (no meaningful change)\n- Only 1 of 76 test files refactored\n- Saved ~10 DB initializations out of 280\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (REALISTIC)\n\nThis task is NOT complete until:\n- [ ] All P1 files refactored (create ✅, dep, stale, comments, list, ready)\n- [ ] Test suite runs in \u003c 2 minutes\n- [ ] Measured and verified actual speedup\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refactor remaining 5 P1 files: dep_test.go, stale_test.go, comments_test.go, list_test.go, ready_test.go\n2. Measure actual time improvement after each file\n3. Continue with P2 files if needed to hit \u003c2min target","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-21T11:37:47.886207-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.209116-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-1rh","depends_on_id":"bd-c49","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-21T11:49:26.347518-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc,-1","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:23:57.978339-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

Large issue lists with full dependencies/dependents exceed this.\n\nSolution:\n- Reduced default list limit from 50 to 20 (server.py:356, models.py:122)\n- Reduced max list limit from 1000 to 100 (models.py:122)\n- Strip dependencies/dependents from list() and ready() responses (server.py:343-350, 368-373)\n- Full dependency details still available via show() command\n\n## Testing\n\n✅ Python syntax validated with py_compile\n✅ Changes are backward compatible\n✅ Persistent context falls back to os.environ for compatibility\n\nUsers should now be able to call set_context() once and have it persist across all subsequent tool calls. Large databases will no longer cause buffer overflow errors.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T14:32:18.315155-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

The .beads/issues.jsonl is intentionally tracked (it's the project's issue database), but contributors' local issues pollute the diff.\n\nThis is a recursion problem unique to self-hosting projects.\n\n## Possible Solutions to Explore\n\n1. **Contributor namespaces** - Each contributor gets a private prefix (e.g., `bd-steve-xxxx`) that's gitignored or filtered\n2. **Separate database** - Contributors use BEADS_DIR pointing elsewhere for personal tracking\n3. **Issue ownership/visibility flags** - Mark issues as \"local-only\" vs \"project\"\n4. **Prefix-based filtering** - Configure which prefixes are committed vs ignored\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n- Should be zero-friction for contributors (no manual setup)\n- Must not break existing workflows\n- Needs to work with sync/collaboration features\n- Consider: what if a \"personal\" issue graduates to \"project\" issue?\n\n## Expansion Needed\n\nThis is a placeholder.

Expired tombstones (\u003e30 days) remain in issues.jsonl\n3. User must separately run `bd compact` to prune tombstones\n4. `bd doctor` warns about expired tombstones: 'Run bd compact to prune'\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd cleanup` should also prune expired tombstones from issues.jsonl.\n\n## Impact\n\nWith v0.30.0 making tombstones the default migration path, this UX gap becomes more visible. Users cleaning up their database shouldn't need to know about a separate `bd compact` command.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCall `pruneExpiredTombstones()` at the end of the cleanup command (same function used by compact).

{"id":"bd-98c4e1fa","title":"Event-driven daemon architecture","description":"Replace 5-second polling sync loop with event-driven architecture that reacts instantly to changes. Eliminates stale data issues while reducing CPU ~60%. Key components: FileWatcher (fsnotify), Debouncer (500ms), RPC mutation events, optional git hooks. Target latency: \u003c500ms (vs 5000ms). See event_driven_daemon.md for full design.","notes":"## Implementation Progress\n\n**Completed:**\n1. ✅ Mutation events infrastructure (bd-143 equivalent)\n   - MutationEvent channel in RPC server\n   - Events emitted for all write operations: create, update, close, label add/remove, dep add/remove, comment add\n   - Non-blocking emission with dropped event counter\n\n2. ✅ FileWatcher with fsnotify (bd-b0c7f7ef related)\n   - Watches .beads/issues.jsonl and .git/refs/heads\n   - 500ms debounce\n   - Polling fallback if fsnotify unavailable\n\n3. ✅ Debouncer (bd-144 equivalent)\n   - 500ms debounce for both export and import triggers\n   - Thread-safe trigger/cancel\n\n4. ✅ Separate export-only and import-only functions\n   - createExportFunc(): exports + optional commit/push (no pull/import)\n   - createAutoImportFunc(): pull + import (no export)\n   - Target latency \u003c500ms achieved by avoiding full sync\n\n5. ✅ Dropped events safety net (bd-eef03e0a related)\n   - Atomic counter tracks dropped mutation events\n   - 60-second health check triggers export if events were dropped\n   - Prevents silent data loss from event storms\n\n**Still Needed:**\n- Platform-specific tests (bd-69bce74a)\n- Integration test for mutation→export latency (bd-140)\n- Unit tests for FileWatcher (bd-b0c7f7ef)\n- Unit tests for Debouncer (bd-144)\n- Event storm stress test (bd-eef03e0a)\n- Documentation update (bd-142)\n\n**Next Steps:**\nAdd comprehensive test coverage before enabling events mode by default.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:19:36.203436-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"bd-khnb","title":"bd migrate --update-repo-id triggers auto-import that resurrects deleted issues","description":"**Bug:** Running `bd migrate --update-repo-id` can resurrect previously deleted issues from git history.\n\n## What Happened\n\nUser deleted 490 closed issues:\n- Deletion committed successfully (06d655a) with JSONL at 48 lines\n- Database had 48 issues after deletion\n- User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id` to fix legacy database\n- Migration triggered daemon auto-import\n- JSONL had been restored to 538 issues (from commit 6cd3a32 - before deletion)\n- Auto-import loaded the old JSONL over the cleaned database\n- Result: 490 deleted issues resurrected\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe auto-import logic in `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136`:\n```go\nif isJSONLNewer(jsonlPath) {\n    fmt.Println(\"→ JSONL is newer than database, importing first...\")\n    if err := importFromJSONL(ctx, jsonlPath, renameOnImport); err != nil {\n```\n\nThis checks if JSONL mtime is newer than database and auto-imports. The problem:\n1. Git operations (pull, merge, checkout) can restore old JSONL files\n2. Restored file has recent mtime (time of git operation)\n3. Auto-import sees \"newer\" JSONL and imports it\n4. Old data overwrites current database state\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 19:59: Commit 6cd3a32 restored JSONL to 538 issues from d99222d\n- 20:22: Commit 3520321 (bd sync)\n- 20:23: Commit 06d655a deleted 490 issues → JSONL now 48 lines\n- 20:23: User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id`\n- Migration completed, daemon started\n- Daemon saw JSONL (restored earlier to 538) was \"newer\" than database\n- Auto-import resurrected 490 deleted issues\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss bug** - user deletions can be undone silently\n- Affects any workflow that uses git branches, merges, or checkouts\n- Auto-import has no safety checks against importing older data\n- Users have no warning that old data will overwrite current state\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. **Content-based staleness** (not mtime-based)\n   - Compare JSONL content hash vs database content hash\n   - Only import if content actually changed\n   - Prevents re-importing old data with new mtime\n\n2. **Database timestamp check**\n   - Store \"last export timestamp\" in database metadata\n   - Only import JSONL if it's newer than last export\n   - Prevents importing old JSONL after git operations\n\n3. **User confirmation**\n   - Before auto-import, show diff of what will change\n   - Require confirmation for large changes (\u003e10% issues affected)\n   - Safety valve for destructive imports\n\n4. **Explicit sync mode**\n   - Disable auto-import entirely\n   - Require explicit `bd sync` or `bd import` commands\n   - Trade convenience for safety\n\n## Recommended Solution\n\nCombination of #1 and #2:\n- Add `last_export_timestamp` to database metadata\n- Check JSONL mtime \u003e last_export_timestamp before importing\n- Add content hash check as additional safety\n- Show warning if importing would delete \u003e10 issues\n\nThis preserves auto-import convenience while preventing data loss.\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136` - Auto-import logic\n- `cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go` - Daemon export/import cycle\n- `internal/autoimport/autoimport.go` - Staleness detection\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create and delete some issues, commit to git\n2. Checkout an earlier commit (before deletion)\n3. Checkout back to current commit\n4. JSONL file now has recent mtime but old content\n5. Run any bd command that triggers auto-import\n6.

{"id":"bd-kzxd","title":"Sync protection mechanism resurrects deleted issues","description":"During bd sync, the 'Protecting N issue(s) from left snapshot' logic resurrects issues that are in the deletions manifest, causing UNIQUE constraint failures on subsequent syncs.\n\n## Reproduction\n1. Delete an issue with bd delete (creates tombstone + deletions.jsonl entry)\n2. Run bd sync - succeeds\n3. Run bd sync again - fails with 'UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id'\n\n## Root Cause\nThe protection mechanism (designed to prevent data loss during 3-way merge) keeps a snapshot of issues before sync. When importing after pull, it restores issues from this snapshot even if they're in the deletions manifest.\n\n## Observed Behavior\n- bd-3pd was deleted and added to deletions.jsonl\n- First sync exports tombstone, commits, pulls, imports - succeeds\n- Second sync: protection restores bd-3pd from left snapshot\n- Import tries to create bd-3pd which already exists → UNIQUE constraint error\n\n## Expected Behavior\nIssues in deletions manifest should NOT be restored by protection mechanism.\n\n## Workaround\nManually delete from DB: sqlite3 .beads/beads.db 'DELETE FROM issues WHERE id = \"bd-xxx\"'\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- cmd/bd/sync.go - protection logic\n- cmd/bd/snapshot_manager.go - left snapshot handling\n- internal/importer/importer.go - import with protection","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-13T10:11:02.550663-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

Running 'bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl' doesn't update the file. Running 'bd import' hangs indefinitely.\n\nReproduction context:\n- VC repo: 1137 issues in DB, 309 in JSONL\n- Created 4 new issues with bd create\n- bd export didn't write them to JSONL\n- bd import hung (possibly daemon lock conflict?)\n\nNeed to investigate:\n1. Why export doesn't update JSONL when DB has more issues\n2. Why import hangs\n3. Daemon lock interaction with export/import\n4. File path handling (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl)","notes":"## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue was NOT about file path handling or export failing to update JSONL. The actual problem was:\n\n**Import/Export hanging when daemon is running** due to SQLite lock contention:\n\n1. When daemon is connected, `PersistentPreRun` in main.go returns early without initializing the `store` variable\n2. Import/Export commands then tried to open the database directly with `sqlite.New(dbPath)` \n3. This blocked waiting for the database lock that the daemon already holds → **HANGS INDEFINITELY**\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nModified both import.go and export.go to:\n1. Detect when `daemonClient` is connected\n2. Explicitly close the daemon connection before opening direct SQLite access\n3. Added debug logging to help diagnose similar issues\n\nThis ensures import/export commands always run in direct mode, avoiding lock contention.\n\n## File Path Handling\n\nThe file path confusion (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl) was a red herring. The code uses `filepath.Glob(\"*.jsonl\")` which correctly finds ANY `.jsonl` file in `.beads/` directory, so both filenames work.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:00:55.78797-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-u4f5","title":"bd import silently succeeds when database matches working tree but not git HEAD","description":"**Critical**: bd import reports '0 created, 0 updated' when database matches working tree JSONL, even when working tree is ahead of git HEAD. This gives false confidence that everything is synced with the source of truth.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Start with database synced to working tree .beads/issues.jsonl (376 issues)\n2. Git HEAD has older version of .beads/issues.jsonl (354 issues)\n3. Run: bd import .beads/issues.jsonl\n4. Output: 'Import complete: 0 created, 0 updated'\n\n## Problem\n\nUser expects 'bd import' after 'git pull' to sync database with committed state, but:\n- Command silently succeeds because DB already matches working tree\n- No warning that working tree has uncommitted changes\n- User falsely believes everything is synced with git\n- Violates 'JSONL in git is source of truth' principle\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen .beads/issues.jsonl differs from git HEAD, bd import should:\n1. Detect uncommitted changes: git diff --quiet HEAD .beads/issues.jsonl\n2. Warn user: 'Warning: .beads/issues.jsonl has uncommitted changes (376 lines vs 354 in HEAD)'\n3. Clarify status: 'Import complete: 0 created, 0 updated (already synced with working tree)'\n4. Recommend: 'Run git diff .beads/issues.jsonl to review uncommitted work'\n\n## Impact\n\n- Users can't trust 'bd import' status messages\n- Silent data loss risk if user assumes synced and runs git checkout\n- Breaks mental model of 'JSONL in git = source of truth'\n- Critical for VC's landing-the-plane workflow","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T23:51:28.536822-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

Apply the same fix pattern to `AddComment` and `ApplyCompaction`: check RowsAffected() after UPDATE and before event INSERT.\n2. Ensure error messages are consistent (\"issue %s not found\").\n3.

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc, bd-81abb639","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267237-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

(y/n)'\n- mv prompting 'overwrite file? (y/n)'  \n- rm prompting 'remove file?'\n\nThis happens because macOS aliases or shell configs may have -i flags set by default.\n\nRoot cause: Claude Code runs commands that trigger interactive confirmation prompts, but cannot respond to them, causing the agent to hang indefinitely.\n\nObserved in: Multiple polecats during GH issues swarm (Dec 2024)\n- Derrick, Roustabout, Prospector, Warboy all got stuck on y/n prompts\n\nSuggested fixes:\n1. AGENTS.md should instruct agents to always use -f flag with cp/mv/rm\n2. Polecat startup could set shell aliases to use non-interactive versions\n3. bd prime hook could include guidance about non-interactive commands\n4.

Prefer issues.jsonl\n2. Fall back to beads.jsonl for legacy support\n3. Skip deletions.jsonl and merge artifacts\n4. Default to issues.jsonl if nothing found\n\n## Problem\n\nCode duplication means bug fixes need to be applied in multiple places (as we just experienced with bd-tqo).\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nExtract shared logic to a utility package that both can import. Options:\n1. Create `internal/jsonlpath` package with the core logic\n2. Have `autoimport` import `beads` and call `FindJSONLPath` (but APIs differ slightly)\n3. Move to `internal/utils` if appropriate\n\nNeed to verify no import cycles would be created.\n\n## Affected Files\n- internal/autoimport/autoimport.go\n- internal/beads/beads.go","status":"tombstone","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-26T23:45:18.974339-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bd-36870264","title":"Enforce daemon singleton per workspace with file locking","description":"Agent in ~/src/wyvern discovered 4 simultaneous daemon processes running, causing infinite directory recursion (.beads/.beads/.beads/...). Each daemon used relative paths and created nested .beads/ directories.\n\nRoot cause: No singleton enforcement. Multiple `bd daemon` processes can start in same workspace.\n\nExpected: One daemon per workspace (each workspace = separate .beads/ dir with bd.sock)\nActual: Multiple daemons can run simultaneously in same workspace\n\nNote: Separate git clones = separate workspaces = separate daemons (correct). Git worktrees share .beads/ and have known limitations (documented, use --no-daemon).","notes":"## Fix Summary\n\nSuccessfully prevented the nested .beads/.beads/ recursion bug by implementing two safeguards:\n\n1. **Path Canonicalization in FindDatabasePath()** (beads.go):\n   - Added filepath.Abs() + filepath.EvalSymlinks() to normalize all database paths\n   - Prevents relative path edge cases that create nested directories\n   - Ensures all daemons see the same canonical path\n\n2. **Nested Directory Detection** (daemon_lifecycle.go):\n   - Added explicit check for \".beads/.beads\" pattern in setupDaemonLock()\n   - Fails fast with clear error message if nested structure detected\n   - Provides user hints about proper usage\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe daemon lock (added Oct 22, 2025) correctly prevents simultaneous daemons in the SAME workspace. However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1. Second daemon start fails with \"daemon already running\" error\n✅ 2. Killing daemon releases lock, new daemon can start  \n✅ 3. No infinite .beads/ recursion possible (tested nested BEADS_DB path)\n✅ 4. Works with auto-start mechanism\n\nThe fix addresses the edge case while maintaining the existing lock mechanism's correctness.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-25T23:13:12.269549-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-22e0bde9","title":"Add TestNWayCollision for 5+ clones","description":"## Overview\nAdd comprehensive tests for N-way (5+) collision resolution to verify the solution scales beyond 3 clones.\n\n## Purpose\nWhile TestThreeCloneCollision validates the basic N-way case, we need to verify:\n1. Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.974702-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Use a lock file (e.g., .beads/.daemon.lock) with PID\n2. On daemon start, check if lock exists and process is alive\n3. If stale lock (dead PID), clean up and acquire lock\n4. If active daemon exists, either:\n   - Exit with message 'daemon already running (PID xxx)'\n   - Or offer --replace flag to kill existing and take over\n5. Release lock on graceful shutdown\n\n**Edge cases to handle:**\n- Daemon crashes without releasing lock (stale PID detection)\n- Multiple repos in same directory tree (each repo gets own lock)\n- Race between two daemons starting simultaneously (atomic lock acquisition)","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-13T06:37:23.377131-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T00:47:00.987715-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-14T00:47:00.987715-08:00","deleted_by":"git-history-backfill","delete_reason":"recovered from git history (pruned from manifest)","original_type":"bug"}

JSONL becomes dirty again immediately\n6. Repeat\n\nThis has been happening for **weeks** and is extremely frustrating.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe recommended conflict resolution (`git checkout --theirs`) throws away local database state (comments, dependencies, closed issues).

Repeat\n\n### Fix\nAdded `dbNeedsExport()` function in `integrity.go` that checks:\n- If JSONL exists\n- If DB modification time is newer than JSONL\n- If DB and JSONL issue counts match\n\nNow `bd sync` only re-exports if DB actually has changes that differ from JSONL.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `dbNeedsExport()` in `cmd/bd/integrity.go` (lines 228-271)\n- Updated `sync.go` lines 217-251 to check before re-exporting\n- Added comprehensive tests in `cmd/bd/sync_merge_test.go`\n\n### Testing\nAll tests pass including 4 new tests:\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_InSync` - Verifies no export when synced\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_DBNewer` - Detects DB modifications\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_CountMismatch` - Catches divergence\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_NoJSONL` - Handles missing JSONL\n\nThis prevents the weeks-long frustration of merge conflicts causing infinite dirty loops.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:52:14.776063-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}
{"id":"bd-17d5","title":"bd sync false positive: conflict detection triggers on JSON-encoded angle brackets in issue content","description":"The bd sync --import-only command incorrectly detects conflict markers when issue descriptions contain the text '\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c' or '\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e' as legitimate content (e.g., documentation about git conflict markers).\n\n**Reproduction:**\n1. Create issue with design field containing: 'Read file, extract \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c / ======= / \u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e markers'\n2.

Pull from remote\n5. bd sync --import-only fails with: 'Git conflict markers detected in JSONL file'\n\n**Root cause:**\nThe conflict detection appears to decode JSON before checking for conflict markers, causing false positives when issue content legitimately contains these strings.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nConflict detection should only trigger on actual git conflict markers (literal '\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c' bytes in the raw file), not on JSON-encoded content within issue fields.\n\n**Test case:**\nVC project at ~/src/dave/vc has vc-85 'JSONL Conflict Parser' which documents conflict parsing and triggers this bug.\n\n**Suggested fixes:**\n1. Only scan for literal '\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c' bytes (not decoded JSON content)\n2. Parse JSONL first and only flag unparseable lines\n3. Check git merge state (git status) to confirm actual conflict\n4.

{"id":"bd-3ee1","title":"Sync sanitize incorrectly removes newly created issues","description":"## Problem\n\nThe sync sanitize process incorrectly identifies newly created issues as 'deleted issues resurrected by git merge' and removes them from the local JSONL file.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Create a new issue: bd create --title='Test issue'\n2. Run bd sync\n3. Observe: New issue appears in sanitize removal list\n4. Issue is removed from local JSONL but preserved on beads-sync branch\n\n## Observed Behavior\n\nDuring sync, the sanitize step outputs:\n```\n→ Sanitized JSONL: removed 738 deleted issue(s) that were resurrected by git merge\n  - bd-08ea  (newly created issue!)\n  - bd-tnsq  (newly created issue!)\n  ...\n```\n\nThe newly created issues get removed locally but remain on beads-sync branch.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nNewly created issues should NOT be removed by sanitize. The sanitize should only remove issues that:\n1. Were previously deleted (have tombstones or are in deletions manifest)\n2. Are being resurrected from old git history\n\n## Root Cause Investigation\n\nThe sanitize logic likely compares the local DB snapshot against some reference and incorrectly classifies new issues as 'resurrected deleted issues'. Possible causes:\n- Snapshot protection logic not accounting for new issues\n- Deletion manifest containing stale entries\n- Race condition between export and sanitize\n\n## Impact\n\n- New issues disappear from local JSONL after sync\n- Issues remain on beads-sync but cause confusion\n- Multi-agent workflows affected when agents can't see new issues locally\n- Requires manual intervention to recover\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- cmd/bd/sync.go - sanitize logic\n- cmd/bd/snapshot_manager.go - snapshot comparison\n- Deletion manifest handling\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Newly created issues survive sync without being sanitized\n- [ ] Only truly deleted/resurrected issues are removed\n- [ ] Add test case for this scenario","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-14T00:45:26.828547-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

These appear to be leftover test data from test runs.\n\nNeed to investigate:\n1. Why are test issues not being cleaned up after tests?\n2. Are tests creating issues in the main database instead of test databases?\n3. Should we add better test isolation or cleanup hooks?\n4. Can we add a label/prefix to distinguish test issues from real issues?\n\nThese test issues have characteristics:\n- Empty descriptions\n- Generic titles like \"Test issue 0\", \"Bug P0\", \"Issue to reopen with reason\"\n- Created around 2025-11-07 19:00-19:07\n- Some assigned to test users like \"alice\", \"bob\", \"testuser\"","notes":"## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Problem**: Python MCP integration tests created test issues in production `.beads/beads.db` instead of isolated test databases.\n\n**Evidence**:\n- 29 test issues created on Nov 7, 2025 at 19:00-19:07\n- Patterns: \"Bug P0\", \"Test issue X\", assignees \"alice\"/\"bob\"/\"testuser\"\n- Git commit 0e8936b shows test issues committed to .beads/beads.jsonl\n- Tests were being fixed for workspace isolation around the same time\n\n**Why It Happened**:\n1. Before commit 0e8936b, `test_client_lazy_initialization()` didn't set `BEADS_WORKING_DIR`\n2. Tests fell back to discovering `.beads/` in the project root directory\n3. Auto-sync committed test issues to production database\n\n**Resolution**:\n1. ✅ Closed 29 test pollution issues (bd-0do3, bd-cjxp, etc.)\n2. ✅ Added `failIfProductionDatabase()` guard in Go test helpers\n3. ✅ Added production pollution checks in RPC test setup\n4. ✅ Created `conftest.py` with pytest safety checks for Python tests\n5. ✅ Added `BEADS_TEST_MODE` env var to mark test execution\n6. ✅ Tests now fail fast if they detect production database usage\n\n**Prevention**:\n- All test helper functions now verify database paths are in temp directories\n- Python tests fail immediately if BEADS_DB points to production\n- BEADS_TEST_MODE flag helps identify test vs production execution\n- Clear error messages guide developers to use proper test isolation\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- cmd/bd/test_helpers_test.go - Added failIfProductionDatabase()\n- internal/rpc/rpc_test.go - Added temp directory verification\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/conftest.py - New file with pytest safeguards","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T21:31:34.845887-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

No daemon required.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. **Worktree lifecycle**: Create on first use, reuse thereafter\n2. **Daemon interaction**: Ensure daemon and bd sync don't conflict\n3. **MCP server**: Uses daemon or direct mode - needs same behavior\n4. **Pull semantics**: Pull from sync branch, not current branch\n5. **Push semantics**: Push to sync branch remote\n6. **Error handling**: Worktree corruption, missing branch, etc.\n\n## Affected Components\n\n- `cmd/bd/sync.go` - Main changes\n- `cmd/bd/daemon_sync_branch.go` - Reuse existing functions\n- `internal/git/worktree.go` - Already implemented\n- MCP server (if it bypasses daemon)\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- Fresh clone (no sync branch exists yet)\n- Worktree exists but is corrupted\n- Concurrent bd sync from multiple processes\n- sync.branch configured but remote doesn't have that branch\n- User switches sync.branch config mid-session","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-30T00:31:20.026356-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","status":"tombstone","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267736-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

Issue #173 on GitHub tracks this.\n\n## Current Status\n- **Lint job**: ✅ PASSING\n- **Test (Linux)**: ❌ FAILING (exit code 1)\n- **Test (Windows)**: ❌ FAILING (exit code 1)\n- **Test Nix Flake**: ❌ FAILING (exit code 1)\n\n## Key Observations\nAll three failing jobs show identical pattern:\n- Individual test output shows PASS for every test\n- Final result: `FAIL github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd`\n- Exit code 1 despite no visible test failures\n- Last visible test output before failure: \"No Reason Issue\" test (TestCloseCommand/close_without_reason)\n\n## Investigation So Far\n1. All tests appear to pass when examined individually\n2. Likely causes:\n   - Race detector finding data races during test cleanup (`-race` flag)\n   - Panic/error occurring after main tests complete\n   - Test harness issue not reporting actual failure\n   - Possible regression from PR #203 (dependency_type changes)\n\n## Recent CI Runs\n- Run 19015040655 (latest): 3/4 failing\n- Multiple recent commits tried to fix Windows/lint issues\n- Agent on rrnewton/beads fork attempting fixes (2/4 passing there)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Run tests locally with `-race -v` to see full output\n2. Check for unreported test failures or panics\n3. Examine test cleanup/teardown code\n4. Review recent changes around close command tests\n5. Consider if race detector is too sensitive or catching real issues","notes":"## Progress Update\n\n### ✅ Fixed (commits 09bd4d3, 21a29bc)\n1. **Daemon auto-import** - Always recompute content_hash in importer to avoid stale hashes\n2. **TestScripts failures** - Added bd binary to PATH for shell subprocess tests\n3. **Test infrastructure** - Added .gitignore to test repos, fixed last_import_time metadata\n\n### ✅ CI Status (Run 19015638968)\n- **Test (Linux)**: ✅ SUCCESS - All tests passing\n- **Test (Windows)**: ❌ FAILURE - Pre-existing Windows test failures\n- **Test Nix Flake**: ❌ FAILURE - Build fails with same test errors\n- **Lint**: ❌ FAILURE - Pre-existing issue in migrate.go:647\n\n### ❌ Remaining Issues (not related to original bd-1231)\n\n**Windows failures:**\n- TestFindDatabasePathEnvVar\n- TestHashIDs_MultiCloneConverge  \n- TestHashIDs_IdenticalContentDedup\n- TestDatabaseReinitialization (5 subtests)\n- TestFindBeadsDir_NotFound\n- TestMetricsSnapshot/uptime\n\n**Lint failure:**\n- cmd/bd/migrate.go:647:37: cleanupWALFiles - result 0 (error) is always nil (unparam)\n\n**Nix failure:**\n- Build fails during test phase with same test errors\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Investigate Windows-specific test failures\n2. Fix linting issue in migrate.go\n3. Debug Nix build test failures","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T08:42:16.142128-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-qq2i","title":"Add 'bd message send' command for Agent Mail messaging","description":"Agent Mail server supports messaging between agents, but bd CLI only uses it for file reservations. Add commands for inter-agent messaging.\n\n## Background\n- Agent Mail server running at http://127.0.0.1:8765\n- 12 workspaces configured across 3 channels (beads.dev, vc.dev, wyvern.dev)\n- Current integration: file reservations only\n- Gap: no way to send messages from bd CLI\n\n## Proposed Commands\n\n```bash\n# Send message to another agent\nbd message send \u003cto-agent\u003e \u003cmessage\u003e [options]\n  --subject \u003csubject\u003e\n  --thread-id \u003cthread-id\u003e     # Optional - group related messages\n  --project-id \u003cproject\u003e      # Defaults to BEADS_PROJECT_ID\n\n# List inbox messages\nbd message inbox [options]\n  --limit \u003cN\u003e\n  --unread-only\n\n# Read specific message\nbd message read \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n\n# Mark message as acknowledged\nbd message ack \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\n# Send message to agent in same channel\nbd message send cino-beads-stevey-macbook \"Working on bd-z0yn, need your review\" \\\n  --subject \"Review request\" \\\n  --thread-id bd-z0yn\n\n# Check inbox\nbd message inbox --unread-only\n\n# Read and acknowledge\nbd message read msg-abc123\nbd message ack msg-abc123\n```\n\n## Design Notes\n- Use same env vars (BEADS_AGENT_MAIL_URL, BEADS_AGENT_NAME, BEADS_PROJECT_ID)\n- Graceful degradation if Agent Mail unavailable\n- JSON output support for all commands\n- Consider integrating with bd update/close (auto-notify on status changes)\n\n## References\n- Agent Mail README: ~/src/mcp_agent_mail/README.md\n- Beads integration docs: docs/AGENT_MAIL.md","notes":"## Implementation Summary\n\nAdded four new commands to bd CLI for Agent Mail messaging:\n\n1. `bd message send \u003cto-agent\u003e \u003cmessage\u003e` - Send messages to other agents\n   - Flags: --subject, --thread-id, --importance, --ack-required\n   - Supports markdown content\n   - Thread conversations by issue ID\n\n2. `bd message inbox` - List inbox messages\n   - Flags: --limit, --unread-only, --urgent-only, --json\n   - Shows subject, sender, age, importance\n   - Highlights unread and ACK-required messages\n\n3. `bd message read \u003cmessage-id\u003e` - Read and mark message as read\n   - Automatically marks message as read\n   - Shows message content\n\n4. `bd message ack \u003cmessage-id\u003e` - Acknowledge a message\n   - Marks message as acknowledged\n   - Also marks as read if not already\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Uses JSON-RPC over HTTP to communicate with Agent Mail server\n- Configuration via environment variables (BEADS_AGENT_MAIL_URL, BEADS_AGENT_NAME, BEADS_PROJECT_ID)\n- Graceful error messages when Agent Mail not configured\n- Full JSON output support for programmatic use\n- Follows same patterns as existing bd commands\n\n## Documentation\n\nUpdated:\n- docs/AGENT_MAIL.md - Added \"Messaging Commands\" section with examples and best practices\n- README.md - Added \"Messaging (Agent Mail)\" section in Usage\n\n## Testing\n\n- Compiles successfully\n- Help output works correctly\n- Ready for integration testing with Agent Mail server","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-08T12:44:03.547806-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}

{"id":"bd-b55e2ac2","title":"Fix autoimport tests for content-hash collision scoring","description":"## Overview\nThree autoimport tests are failing after bd-cbed9619.4 because they expect behavior based on the old reference-counting collision resolution, but the system now uses deterministic content-hash scoring.\n\n## Failing Tests\n1. `TestAutoImportMultipleCollisionsRemapped` - expects local versions preserved\n2. `TestAutoImportAllCollisionsRemapped` - expects local versions preserved  \n3. `TestAutoImportCollisionRemapMultipleFields` - expects specific collision resolution behavior\n\n## Root Cause\nThese tests were written when ScoreCollisions used reference counting to determine which version to keep. Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:28.358028-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bd-io0","title":"sync.branch config lost on clone - should be in config.yaml","description":"## Problem\n\nThe sync.branch configuration is stored in the SQLite database, which is gitignored. When contributors clone a repo that uses beads:\n\n1. They get .beads/issues.jsonl (tracked)\n2. They don't get .beads/beads.db (gitignored)\n3. They lose the sync.branch config\n\nWhen they run 'bd init' or 'bd doctor --fix', sync.branch gets auto-set to the current branch (usually 'main'), but if the project uses a dedicated sync branch like 'beads-sync', they'll be committing to the wrong branch.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nsyncbranch.Get() only checks:\n1. BEADS_SYNC_BRANCH env var\n2. Database config (store.GetConfig)\n\nIt never reads from config.yaml, which IS tracked in git and persists across clones.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd sync-branch support to config.yaml with this precedence:\n1. BEADS_SYNC_BRANCH env var (highest)\n2. config.yaml sync-branch setting\n3. Database config (legacy/local override)\n4. Auto-detect from current branch (lowest)\n\nChanges needed:\n1. Update syncbranch.Get() to check config.GetString('sync-branch') between env and database\n2. Update config.yaml template in init.go to include sync-branch\n3. Update docs to recommend setting sync-branch in config.yaml for team projects\n4.

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:12:56.344193-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-dcd6f14b to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:52:05.462747-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.2","title":"Implement content-first idempotent import","description":"## Overview\nPhase 4: Refactor import to be content-first and idempotent, ensuring importing same JSONL multiple times always converges correctly.\n\n## Current Problem\nCurrent import is ID-first:\n1. Look up by ID\n2. If exists, update\n3. If not exists, create\n\nThis causes issues when:\n- Same content arrives with different IDs (renames not detected)\n- Multiple rounds of import needed for convergence\n- Import order affects final state\n\n## Solution\nMake import content-first and idempotent:\n1. Hash all incoming and existing issues\n2. Match by content hash first (detect renames)\n3. Handle ID conflicts second (using global resolution)\n4. Ensure importing same data multiple times = no-op\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Refactor ImportIssues to be content-first\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\n```go\nfunc ImportIssues(ctx context.Context, dbPath string, store storage.Storage, \n    issues []*types.Issue, opts Options) (*Result, error) {\n    \n    result := \u0026Result{...}\n    \n    sqliteStore, needCloseStore, err := getOrCreateStore(ctx, dbPath, store)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    if needCloseStore {\n        defer func() { _ = sqliteStore.Close() }()\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 1: Compute content hashes for all incoming issues\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        issue.ContentHash = issue.ComputeContentHash()\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Build content hash maps\n    incomingByHash := buildHashMap(issues)\n    dbIssues, _ := sqliteStore.SearchIssues(ctx, \"\", types.IssueFilter{})\n    dbByHash := buildHashMap(dbIssues)\n    dbByID := buildIDMap(dbIssues)\n    \n    // Phase 3: Content-first matching\n    var newIssues []*types.Issue\n    var idConflicts []*CollisionDetail\n    \n    for hash, incoming := range incomingByHash {\n        if existing, found := dbByHash[hash]; found {\n            // Same content exists\n            if existing.ID == incoming.ID {\n                // Exact match - idempotent case\n                result.Unchanged++\n            } else {\n                // Same content, different ID - rename detected\n                // Delete old ID, keep new ID (incoming is canonical)\n                if err := handleRename(ctx, sqliteStore, existing, incoming); err != nil {\n                    return nil, err\n                }\n                result.Updated++\n            }\n        } else {\n            // New content - check for ID collision\n            if existingWithID, found := dbByID[incoming.ID]; found {\n                // ID exists but different content - collision\n                idConflicts = append(idConflicts, \u0026CollisionDetail{\n                    ID:            incoming.ID,\n                    IncomingIssue: incoming,\n                    ExistingIssue: existingWithID,\n                })\n            } else {\n                // Truly new issue\n                newIssues = append(newIssues, incoming)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 4: Resolve ID conflicts using global algorithm\n    if len(idConflicts) \u003e 0 {\n        if !opts.ResolveCollisions {\n            return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"collision detected\")\n        }\n        \n        idMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n            idConflicts, issues)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        \n        if err := applyIDMapping(ctx, sqliteStore, idMapping); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        \n        result.IDMapping = idMapping\n        result.Collisions = len(idConflicts)\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 5: Create new issues\n    if len(newIssues) \u003e 0 {\n        if err := sqliteStore.CreateIssues(ctx, newIssues, \"import\"); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        result.Created = len(newIssues)\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 6: Import dependencies, labels, comments (existing logic)\n    // ...\n    \n    return result, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// buildHashMap creates a map of content hash → issue\nfunc buildHashMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// buildIDMap creates a map of ID → issue\nfunc buildIDMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ID] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// handleRename handles content match with different IDs\nfunc handleRename(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage, \n    existing *types.Issue, incoming *types.Issue) error {\n    \n    // Delete old ID\n    if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, existing.ID); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete old ID %s: %w\", existing.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Create with new ID\n    if err := s.CreateIssue(ctx, incoming, \"import-rename\"); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create renamed issue %s: %w\", \n            incoming.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Update references from old ID to new ID\n    idMapping := map[string]string{existing.ID: incoming.ID}\n    return updateReferences(ctx, s, idMapping)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add idempotency tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. Import same JSONL twice → second import reports all Unchanged\n2. Import, modify DB, import again → reports Updated\n3. Import with rename, import again → idempotent\n4. Import with collision resolution, import again → idempotent\n\n### 4. Update handleCollisions to use new flow\nCurrent handleCollisions in importer.go needs to be updated to:\n- Use content-first matching\n- Call new ResolveNWayCollisions\n- Apply results using ApplyCollisionResolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Import matches by content hash before checking IDs\n- Importing same JSONL multiple times is idempotent (reports Unchanged)\n- Rename detection works (same content, different ID)\n- ID conflicts resolved using global algorithm\n- Result.Unchanged correctly tracks idempotent imports\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes\n- All existing import tests still pass\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- buildHashMap correctly indexes by content hash\n- buildIDMap correctly indexes by ID\n- handleRename deletes old, creates new, updates references\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Import same data twice → idempotent\n- Import renamed issue → handled correctly\n- Import with collision → resolved globally\n- Final pull after 3-way collision → all clones converge\n\n### Property Tests\n- Idempotency: Import(x); Import(x) ≡ Import(x)\n- Commutativity: Import(a); Import(b) ≡ Import(b); Import(a) (for non-colliding issues)\n- Convergence: After N rounds of sync, all clones identical\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/importer/importer.go (major refactor of ImportIssues)\n- internal/importer/importer_test.go (new tests)\n- cmd/bd/import_bug_test.go (update for new behavior)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.3 (global resolution)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nMajor refactor of import logic. Recommend:\n1. Comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Feature flag to enable/disable\n3. Keep old import code path for rollback\n4. Test with all existing import tests\n5. Manual testing with real repositories\n\n## Success Metrics\nAfter this phase:\n- TestThreeCloneCollision should PASS\n- All clones converge after final pull\n- Import is demonstrably idempotent\n- No data loss in N-way scenarios","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:38:25.671302-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.229134-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:21:39.529971-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.616846-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.360026-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.383624-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.407157-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"bd-vw8","title":"Switch from deletions manifest to inline tombstones","description":"Replace the current deletions.jsonl manifest with inline tombstone records in issues.jsonl.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe current deletions manifest approach has several issues:\n\n1. **Wild poisoning** - A stale clone's deletions manifest can poison fresh databases when synced\n2. **Two-level merge inconsistency** - Git content merge and beads snapshot merge use different bases\n3. **SyncJSONLToWorktree overwrites** - Blindly copies local JSONL to worktree, losing remote issues\n4. **3-day TTL too aggressive** - Deletions expire before dormant branches get merged\n\n## Proposed Solution: Inline Tombstones\n\nInstead of a separate deletions.jsonl file, embed deletion records directly in issues.jsonl:\n\n```json\n{\"id\":\"beads-abc\",\"status\":\"tombstone\",\"title\":\"Original title\",\"deleted_at\":\"2025-12-01T...\",\"deleted_by\":\"user\",\"expires_at\":\"2025-12-31T...\"}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Single source of truth** - No separate manifest to sync/merge\n2. **Participates in normal 3-way merge** - Deletion conflicts resolved same as other fields\n3. **Atomic with issue data** - Can't have orphaned deletions or missing tombstones\n4. **Preserves metadata** - Can optionally keep title/type for audit trail\n\n### Design Decisions Needed\n\n1. **TTL duration** - 30 days default? Configurable via config.yaml?\n2. **Tombstone content** - Minimal (just ID + timestamps) vs. full issue preservation?\n3. **Migration path** - How to handle existing deletions.jsonl files?\n4. **Status value** - Use \"tombstone\" or \"deleted\"? (tombstone clearer, deleted more intuitive)\n5. **Merge semantics** - Does tombstone always win, or use updated_at like other fields?\n\n### Migration Strategy\n\n1. On import, convert deletions.jsonl entries to tombstones in JSONL\n2. Deprecate but still read deletions.jsonl for backward compatibility\n3. Stop writing to deletions.jsonl after N versions\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- GitHub #464: Beads deletes issues (fresh clone sync problem)\n- bd-2e0: Add TTL to deletions manifest entries (current 3-day TTL)\n- bd-53c: bd sync corrupts issues.jsonl in multi-clone environments","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-05T13:42:24.384792-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-1r5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:31.111259-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-2m7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:33.57722-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-dli","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:34.902784-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-zvg","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:36.665817-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-fbj","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.081452-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-olt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.118268-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-0ih","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.155689-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-3b4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.192575-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-dve","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.227233-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-8f9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.262816-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-s3v","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.299481-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-okh","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.337656-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"bd-f2f","title":"CRITICAL: bd sync exports before pull, allowing stale DB to corrupt JSONL statuses","description":"## Root Cause\n\nThe fix in bd-53c (reverse ZFC check) only checks COUNTS, not content. The real corruption happens when:\n\n1. Polecat A has stale DB with old status values (e.g., status=closed for issues that are now open on remote)\n2. Polecat A runs bd sync:\n   - **Export FIRST**: DB (status=closed) → JSONL (overwrites correct status=open)\n   - Commit: Stale JSONL committed\n   - Pull: 3-way merge with remote\n   - Merge uses 'closed wins' rule → status stays closed\n3. Polecat A pushes → Remote now corrupted with status=closed\n\n## Why bd-53c didn't fix it\n\nThe reverse ZFC check compares COUNTS:\n```go\nif jsonlCount \u003e dbCount  // Only catches count mismatch\n```\n\nBut in the corruption scenario:\n- JSONL count = 5, DB count = 5 (same count!)\n- Only the STATUS field differs\n\n## The Real Fix\n\n**PULL BEFORE EXPORT**. The sync order must be:\n1. Pull from remote (get latest state)\n2. Import merged JSONL to DB\n3. THEN export DB changes (if any)\n\nCurrent order is: Export → Commit → Pull → Import → Push\n\nThis is a fundamental architecture change to the sync flow.\n\n## Workaround\n\nUse --no-auto-flush and manually control the sync order, or disable daemon auto-export.\n\n## Evidence\n\nFrom user investigation:\n- At 595b7943 (13:20:30): 5 open issues\n- At 10239812 (13:28:39): 0 open issues\n- All 5 issues had their status changed from open to closed\n- Count stayed at 5 (not a deletion issue)","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-29T17:33:26.744766-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

This causes:\n\n1. Race conditions: 8+ daemons watching same .beads/beads.db, each with own 30s debounce timer\n2. Git conflicts: Multiple daemons racing to commit/push .beads/issues.jsonl\n3. Resource waste: Orphaned daemons from sessions days/hours old still running\n\nExample: User had 8 daemons from multiple sessions (12:37AM, 7:20PM, 7:22PM, 7:47PM, 9:19PM yesterday + 9:54AM, 10:55AM today).\n\nSolutions to consider:\n1. Track parent PID and exit when parent dies\n2. Use single global daemon instead of per-session\n3. Document manual cleanup: pkill -f \"bd daemon\"\n4. Add daemon lifecycle management (auto-cleanup of stale daemons)","notes":"Implementation complete:\n\n1. Added ParentPID field to DaemonLockInfo struct (stored in daemon.lock JSON)\n2.

{"id":"bd-70419816","title":"Export deduplication breaks when JSONL and export_hashes table diverge","description":"## Problem\n\nThe export deduplication feature (timestamp-only skipping) breaks when the JSONL file and export_hashes table get out of sync, causing exports to skip issues that aren't actually in the file.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- `bd export` reports \"Skipped 128 issue(s) with timestamp-only changes\"\n- JSONL file only has 38 lines but DB has 149 issues\n- export_hashes table has 149 entries\n- Auto-import doesn't trigger (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Two repos on same commit show different issue counts\n\n## Root Cause\n\nshouldSkipExport() in autoflush.go compares current issue hash with stored export_hashes entry. If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-4ba5908b","title":"Implement content-hash based collision resolution for deterministic convergence","description":"The current collision resolution uses creation timestamps to decide which issue to keep vs. remap. This is non-deterministic when two clones create issues at nearly the same time.\n\nRoot cause of bd-71107098:\n- Clone A creates test-1=\"Issue from clone A\" at T0\n- Clone B creates test-1=\"Issue from clone B\" at T0+30ms\n- Clone B syncs first, remaps Clone A's to test-2\n- Clone A syncs second, sees collision, remaps Clone B's to test-2\n- Result: titles are swapped between clones\n\nSolution:\n- Use content-based hashing (title + description + priority + type)\n- Deterministic winner: always keep issue with lower hash\n- Same collision on different clones produces same result (idempotent)\n\nImplementation:\n- Modify ScoreCollisions in internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n- Replace timestamp-based scoring with content hash comparison\n- Ensure hash function is stable across platforms","notes":"Rename detection successfully implemented and tested!\n\n**What was implemented:**\n1. Content-hash based rename detection in DetectCollisions\n2. When importing JSONL, if an issue has different ID but same content as DB issue, treat as rename\n3. Delete old ID and accept new ID from JSONL\n4. Added post-import re-export in sync command to flush rename changes\n5. Added post-import commit to capture rename changes\n\n**Test results:**\nTestTwoCloneCollision now shows full convergence:\n- Clone A: test-2=\"Issue from clone A\", test-1=\"Issue from clone B\"\n- Clone B: test-1=\"Issue from clone B\", test-2=\"Issue from clone A\"\n\nBoth clones have **identical content** (titles match IDs correctly). Only timestamps differ (expected).\n\n**What remains:**\n- Test still expects exact JSON match including timestamps\n- Could normalize timestamp comparison, but content convergence is the critical success metric\n- The two-clone collision workflow now works without data corruption!","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T17:04:11.530026-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-4ba5908b","depends_on_id":"bd-71107098","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T17:04:18.149604-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Convert most tests to in-process testing (call bd functions directly)\n2. Reuse test databases across related operations instead of fresh init each time\n3. Keep a few exec.Command() tests that batch multiple operations to verify the CLI path works end-to-end\n\nThis should reduce test time from ~40s to ~5s for the affected tests.","notes":"Converted all CLI tests in cli_fast_test.go to use in-process testing via rootCmd.Execute().

When it exported, it overwrote the merge with its stale state.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nDaemon should detect that JSONL is newer than its last export and import before exporting.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nDaemon exported stale DB state, creating a conflicting commit that reverted upstream changes.\n\n**Impact:**\nMulti-workspace setups with daemons can silently lose changes if one daemon has stale state and exports.","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-01T21:53:07.930819-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-pdr2","title":"Consider backwards compatibility for ready() and list() return type change","description":"PR #481 changed the return types of `ready()` and `list()` from `list[Issue]` to `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`. This is a breaking change for MCP clients.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nBreaking change affects:\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from ready()\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from list()\n- Client code that accesses full Issue fields (description, design, acceptance_criteria, timestamps, dependencies, dependents)\n\n## Current Behavior\n- ready() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- list() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- show() still returns full `Issue` (good)\n\n## Considerations\n**Pros of current approach:**\n- Forces clients to use show() for full details (good for context efficiency)\n- Simple mental model (always use show for full data)\n- Documentation warns about this\n\n**Cons:**\n- Clients expecting list[Issue] will break\n- No graceful degradation option\n- No migration period\n\n## Potential Solutions\n1. Add optional parameter `full_details=false` to ready/list (would increase payload)\n2. Create separate tools: ready_minimal/list_minimal + ready_full/list_full\n3. Accept breaking change and document upgrade path (current approach)\n4. Version the MCP server and document migration guide\n\n## Recommendation\nCurrent approach (solution 3) is reasonable if:\n- Changelog clearly documents the breaking change\n- Migration guide provided to clients\n- Error handling is graceful for clients expecting specific fields","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:56.460465-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:56.460465-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-pdr2","depends_on_id":"bd-otf4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:56.461959-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

CONTRIBUTING.md is documentation that's read once and forgotten; `bd preflight` is documentation that runs at exactly the right moment.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nContributors face a \"last mile\" problem - they do the work but stumble on project-specific gotchas at PR time:\n- Nix vendorHash gets stale when go.sum changes\n- Beads artifacts leak into PRs (see bd-umbf for namespace solution)\n- Version mismatches between version.go and default.nix\n- Tests/lint not run locally before pushing\n- Other project-specific checks that only surface when CI fails\n\nThese are too obscure to remember, exist in docs nobody reads end-to-end, and waste CI round-trips.\n\n## Why beads?\n\nBeads already has a foothold in the contributor workflow. It knows:\n- Git state (staged files, branch, dirty status)\n- Project structure\n- The specific issue being worked on\n- Project-specific configuration\n\n## Proposed Interface\n\n### Tier 1: Checklist Mode (v1)\n\n    $ bd preflight\n    PR Readiness Checklist:\n\n    [ ] Tests pass: go test -short ./...\n    [ ] Lint passes: golangci-lint run ./...\n    [ ] No beads pollution: check .beads/issues.jsonl diff\n    [ ] Nix hash current: go.sum unchanged or vendorHash updated\n    [ ] Version sync: version.go matches default.nix\n\n    Run 'bd preflight --check' to validate automatically.\n\n### Tier 2: Check Mode (v2)\n\n    $ bd preflight --check\n    ✓ Tests pass\n    ✓ Lint passes\n    ⚠ Beads pollution: 3 issues in diff - are these project issues or personal?\n    ✗ Nix hash stale: go.sum changed, vendorHash needs update\n      Fix: sha256-KRR6dXzsSw8OmEHGBEVDBOoIgfoZ2p0541T9ayjGHlI=\n    ✓ Version sync\n\n    1 error, 1 warning.

{"id":"bd-aydr","title":"Add bd reset command for clean slate restart","description":"Implement a `bd reset` command to reset beads to a clean starting state.\n\n## Context\nGitHub issue #479 - users sometimes get beads into an invalid state after updates, and there's no clean way to start fresh. The git backup/restore mechanism that protects against accidental deletion also makes it hard to intentionally reset.\n\n## Design\n\n### Command Interface\n```\nbd reset [--hard] [--force] [--backup] [--dry-run] [--no-init]\n```\n\n| Flag | Effect |\n|------|--------|\n| `--hard` | Also remove from git index and commit |\n| `--force` | Skip confirmation prompt |\n| `--backup` | Create `.beads-backup-{timestamp}/` first |\n| `--dry-run` | Preview what would happen |\n| `--no-init` | Don't re-initialize after clearing |\n\n### Reset Levels\n1. **Soft Reset (default)** - Kill daemons, clear .beads/, re-init. Git history unchanged.\n2. **Hard Reset (`--hard`)** - Also git rm and commit the removal, then commit fresh state.\n\n### Implementation Flow\n1. Validate .beads/ exists\n2. If not --force: show impact summary, prompt confirmation\n3. If --backup: copy .beads/ to .beads-backup-{timestamp}/\n4. Kill daemons\n5. If --hard: git rm + commit\n6. rm -rf .beads/*\n7. If not --no-init: bd init (and git add+commit if --hard)\n8. Print summary\n\n### Safety Mechanisms\n- Confirmation prompt (skip with --force)\n- Impact summary (issue/tombstone counts)\n- Backup option\n- Dry-run preview\n- Git dirty check warning\n\n### Code Structure\n- `cmd/bd/reset.go` - CLI command\n- `internal/reset/` - Core logic package","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T08:44:01.38379+11:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T00:47:00.952767-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-14T00:47:00.952767-08:00","deleted_by":"git-history-backfill","delete_reason":"recovered from git history (pruned from manifest)","original_type":"epic"}

Provide bd migrate --hash-ids tool.\n\n## Timeline\n~9 weeks (Phase 1: Hash IDs 4w, Phase 2: Aliases 3w, Phase 3: Testing 2w)\n\n## Dependencies\nShould complete after bd-7c5915ae (cleanup validation) and before bd-710a4916 (CRDT).","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:23:49.592315-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","title":"Update MCP server for hash IDs","description":"Update beads-mcp server to support hash IDs and aliases.\n\n## Changes Needed\n\n### 1. MCP Function Signatures (No Change)\nFunctions already use issue IDs as strings, so they work with hash IDs:\n\n```python\n# These already work!\nbeads_show(issue_id: str)           # Accepts bd-af78e9a2 or #42\nbeads_update(issue_id: str, ...)    # Accepts both formats\nbeads_close(issue_ids: List[str])   # Accepts both formats\n```\n\n### 2. Add Alias Resolution Helper\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n\n```python\ndef resolve_issue_id(issue_id: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Resolve alias to hash ID if needed.\"\"\"\n    # Hash ID: pass through\n    if issue_id.startswith('bd-') and len(issue_id) == 11:\n        return issue_id\n    \n    # Alias: #42 or 42\n    alias_str = issue_id.lstrip('#')\n    try:\n        alias = int(alias_str)\n        # Call bd to resolve\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['bd', 'alias', 'find', f'bd-{alias}'],\n            capture_output=True, text=True\n        )\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            return result.stdout.strip()\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Invalid format\n    raise ValueError(f\"Invalid issue ID: {issue_id}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Update Response Formatting\nShow aliases in responses:\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_show(issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    resolved_id = resolve_issue_id(issue_id)\n    \n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'show', resolved_id], ...)\n    \n    # Parse response and add alias info\n    # Format: \"bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #42)\"\n    ...\n```\n\n### 4. Add beads_alias_* Functions\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_list() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"List all alias mappings.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'list'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_set(alias: int, issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Manually assign alias to issue.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'set', str(alias), issue_id], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_compact() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Compact aliases to fill gaps.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'compact'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n```\n\n### 5. Update Documentation\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs (v2.0+)\n\nThe MCP server accepts both hash IDs and aliases:\n\n```python\n# Using hash IDs\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n\n# Using aliases\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"42\")  # Shorthand\n```\n\n## Alias Management\n\nNew functions for alias control:\n\n- `beads_alias_list()` - List all alias mappings\n- `beads_alias_set(alias, issue_id)` - Manually assign alias\n- `beads_alias_compact()` - Compact aliases to fill gaps\n\n## Migration\n\nAfter migrating to hash IDs:\n1. Update beads-mcp: `pip install --upgrade beads-mcp`\n2. Restart MCP server\n3. All existing workflows continue to work\n```\n\n### 6. Version Compatibility\nDetect and handle both v1.x and v2.0 formats:\n\n```python\ndef detect_beads_version() -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Detect if beads is using sequential or hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'list', '-n', '1'], ...)\n    first_id = parse_first_issue_id(result.stdout)\n    \n    if first_id.startswith('bd-') and len(first_id) \u003e 11:\n        return '2.0'  # Hash ID\n    else:\n        return '1.x'  # Sequential ID\n\n# On startup\nbeads_version = detect_beads_version()\nlogger.info(f\"Detected beads version: {beads_version}\")\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py\n\n```python\ndef test_resolve_hash_id():\n    \"\"\"Hash IDs pass through unchanged.\"\"\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"bd-af78e9a2\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_resolve_alias():\n    \"\"\"Aliases resolve to hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    # Mock bd alias find command\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"#42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_invalid_id():\n    \"\"\"Invalid IDs raise ValueError.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        resolve_issue_id(\"invalid\")\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n```python\nasync def test_show_with_hash_id(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text\n\nasync def test_show_with_alias(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text  # Resolved\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\nThe MCP server should work with both:\n- Beads v1.x (sequential IDs)\n- Beads v2.0+ (hash IDs)\n\nDetection happens at runtime based on issue ID format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n- integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py (new)\n- integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml (bump version)\n\n## Deployment\n```bash\ncd integrations/beads-mcp\n# Bump version to 2.0.0\npoetry version 2.0.0\n# Publish to PyPI\npoetry publish --build\n```","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.256074-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.257315-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.258057-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Should close_reason be exported to JSONL format?\n2. If yes, where should it go (root level or nested in events)?\n3. Should there be any special handling to avoid duplication?\n4. How should close_reason be handled during JSONL import?\n\n## Why This Matters\n- JSONL is the git-friendly sync format\n- Other beads instances import from JSONL\n- close_reason is meaningful data that should be preserved across clones\n\n## Suggested Action\n- Check if close_reason is currently exported in JSONL\n- If not, add it to the export schema\n- Document the field in JSONL format spec\n- Add tests for round-trip (export -\u003e import -\u003e verify close_reason)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:25:17.414916-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T14:25:17.414916-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-lxzx","depends_on_id":"bd-z86n","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:25:17.416131-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

This causes \"resurrection\" where deleted issues reappear.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nImport sees DB issues not in JSONL and assumes they're \"local unpushed work\" rather than \"intentionally deleted upstream.\"\n\n## Solution: Deletions Manifest\n\nAdd `.beads/deletions.jsonl` - an append-only log of deleted issue IDs with metadata.\n\n### Format\n```jsonl\n{\"id\":\"bd-xxx\",\"ts\":\"2025-11-25T10:00:00Z\",\"by\":\"stevey\"}\n{\"id\":\"bd-yyy\",\"ts\":\"2025-11-25T10:05:00Z\",\"by\":\"claude\",\"reason\":\"duplicate of bd-zzz\"}\n```\n\n### Fields\n- `id`: Issue ID (required)\n- `ts`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (required)\n- `by`: Actor who deleted (required)\n- `reason`: Optional context (\"cleanup\", \"duplicate of X\", etc.)\n\n### Import Logic\n```\nFor each DB issue not in JSONL:\n  1. Check deletions manifest → if found, delete from DB\n  2. Fallback: check git history → if found, delete + backfill manifest\n  3. Neither → keep (local unpushed work)\n```\n\n### Conflict Resolution\nSimultaneous deletions from multiple clones are handled naturally:\n- Append-only design means both clones append their deletion records\n- On merge, file contains duplicate entries (same ID, different timestamps)\n- `LoadDeletions` deduplicates by ID (keeps any/first entry)\n- Result: deletion propagates correctly, duplicates are harmless\n\n### Pruning Policy\n- Default retention: 7 days (configurable via `deletions.retention_days`)\n- Auto-compact during `bd sync` is **opt-in** (disabled by default)\n- Hard cap: `deletions.max_entries` (default 50000)\n- Git fallback handles pruned entries (self-healing)\n\n### Self-Healing\nWhen git fallback catches a resurrection (pruned entry), it backfills the manifest. One-time git scan cost, then fast again.\n\n### Size Estimates\n- ~80 bytes/entry\n- 7-day retention with 100 deletions/day = ~56KB\n- Git compressed: ~10KB\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Deletions propagate across clones\n- ✅ O(1) lookup (no git scan in normal case)\n- ✅ Works in shallow clones\n- ✅ Survives history rewrite\n- ✅ Audit trail (who deleted what when)\n- ✅ Self-healing via git fallback\n- ✅ Bounded size via time-based pruning\n\n## References\n- Investigation session: 2025-11-25\n- Related: bd-2q6d (stale database warnings)","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:56:01.98027-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-qsm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.821911-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-x2i","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.851712-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-44e","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.88154-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-bhd","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.675787-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-bgs","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.744648-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-f0n","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.80649-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-v29","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.864569-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-mdw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:48.592492-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-03r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:54.295851-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

This is superior to our planned bd resolve-conflicts because it prevents conflicts proactively instead of resolving them after the fact.\n\n**Tool**: https://github.com/neongreen/mono/tree/main/beads-merge\n\n**What it does**:\n- 3-way merge of JSONL files (base, left, right)\n- Field-level merging (titles, status, priority, etc.)\n- Smart dependency merging (union + dedup)\n- Conflict markers for unresolvable conflicts\n- Exit code 1 for conflicts (standard)\n\n**Integration options**:\n\n1. **Recommend (minimal effort)** - Document in AGENTS.md + TROUBLESHOOTING.md\n2. **Bundle binary** - Include in releases (cross-platform builds)\n3. **Port to Go** - Reimplement in bd codebase\n4. **Auto-install hook** - During bd init, offer to install merge driver\n\n**Recommendation**: Start with option 1 (document), then option 2 (bundle) once proven.\n\n**Related**: bd-5f483051 (bd resolve-conflicts - can close as superseded)","notes":"Created GitHub issue to discuss integration approach with @neongreen: https://github.com/neongreen/mono/issues/240\n\nAwaiting their preference on:\n1.

This scenario could occur if: 1) Clone A deletes an issue, 2) Clone B and Clone C both sync from A (getting tombstone), 3) Both B and C independently recreate an issue with same ID. The current code would likely fall through to standard mergeIssue() which may not be correct. Need to add test and verify behavior.

{"id":"bd-5dae5504","title":"Export deduplication breaks when JSONL and export_hashes table diverge","description":"## Problem\n\nThe export deduplication feature (timestamp-only skipping) breaks when the JSONL file and export_hashes table get out of sync, causing exports to skip issues that aren't actually in the file.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- `bd export` reports \"Skipped 128 issue(s) with timestamp-only changes\"\n- JSONL file only has 38 lines but DB has 149 issues\n- export_hashes table has 149 entries\n- Auto-import doesn't trigger (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Two repos on same commit show different issue counts\n\n## Root Cause\n\nshouldSkipExport() in autoflush.go compares current issue hash with stored export_hashes entry. If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6. Add `bd validate` command to detect divergence\n","status":"tombstone","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.959435-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-15T15:57:52.051193-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.1","title":"Fix multi-round convergence for N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\n\nN-way collision resolution is working (IDs get remapped correctly), but clones don't fully converge after a single final pull. Each clone is missing some issues that other clones have.\n\nFrom TestFiveCloneCollision results:\n- Clone A has: A, B\n- Clone B has: A, B  \n- Clone C has: A, B, C\n- Clone D has: A, B, C, D\n- Clone E has: A, B, C, E\n\n**Expected**: All clones should have A, B, C, D, E after final pull.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe current sync workflow does:\n1. Each clone syncs in order (resolving collisions locally)\n2. Final pull to get all changes\n\nBut the final pull itself may need import with collision resolution, which creates new commits. These new commits aren't propagated to other clones, so they remain incomplete.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Option 1: Multi-round final sync**\n- After final pull, do additional sync rounds until all clones converge\n- Check convergence by comparing issue counts or content hashes\n- Maximum N rounds for N clones\n\n**Option 2: Iterative pull-import-push**\n- Each clone: pull → import with --resolve-collisions → push\n- Repeat until no new changes\n- Guaranteed convergence but may create commit spam\n\n**Option 3: Fix auto-import to be truly idempotent**\n- Ensure importing same JSONL multiple times produces no new commits\n- May require smarter content-based deduplication\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes without t.Skip\n- All N clones have all N issues after convergence\n- Convergence happens in bounded rounds (≤ N)\n- No data loss or duplication\n- Works for arbitrary N (tested with 5, 10 clones)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is the final blocker for bd-cbed9619 epic completion.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T21:22:21.486109-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.180996-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T11:02:40.756891-07:00"}

When multiple clones create the same ID with different content, there's no way to identify that these are semantically different issues without comparing all fields.\n\n## Solution\nAdd a ContentHash field to the Issue type that represents the canonical content fingerprint.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Add ContentHash field to Issue type\nFile: internal/types/types.go\n```go\ntype Issue struct {\n    ID          string\n    ContentHash string  // SHA256 of canonical content\n    // ... existing fields\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add content hash computation method\nUse existing hashIssueContent from collision.go:186 as foundation:\n```go\nfunc (i *Issue) ComputeContentHash() string {\n    return hashIssueContent(i)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Compute hash at creation time\n- Modify CreateIssue to compute and store ContentHash\n- Modify CreateIssues (batch) to compute hashes\n\n### 4. Compute hash at import time  \n- Modify ImportIssues to compute ContentHash for all incoming issues\n- Store hash in database\n\n### 5. Add database column\n- Add migration to add content_hash column to issues table\n- Update SELECT/INSERT statements to include content_hash\n- Index on content_hash for fast lookups\n\n### 6. Populate existing issues\n- Add migration step to compute ContentHash for all existing issues\n- Use hashIssueContent function\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Issue type has ContentHash field\n- Hash is computed automatically at creation time\n- Hash is computed for imported issues\n- Database stores content_hash column\n- All existing issues have non-empty ContentHash\n- Hash is deterministic (same content → same hash)\n- Hash excludes ID, timestamps (only semantic content)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/types/types.go\n- internal/storage/sqlite/sqlite.go (schema, CreateIssue, CreateIssues)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/migrations.go (new migration)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (compute hash during import)\n- cmd/bd/create.go (compute hash at creation)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: same content produces same hash\n- Unit test: different content produces different hash  \n- Unit test: hash excludes ID and timestamps\n- Integration test: hash persists in database\n- Migration test: existing issues get hashes populated","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:36:44.914967-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.2279-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T18:57:10.985198-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.547325-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
